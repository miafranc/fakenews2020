    "text": "\n\nDonald Trump bragged in vulgar terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women during a 2005 conversation caught on a hot microphone, saying that \"when you're a star, they let you do it,\" according to a video obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nThe video captures Trump talking with Billy Bush, then of \"Access Hollywood,\" on a bus with the show's name written across the side. They were arriving on the set of \"Days of Our Lives\" to tape a segment about Trump's cameo on the soap opera.\n\nLate Friday night, following sharp criticism by Republican leaders, Trump issued a short video statement saying, \"I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.\" But he also called the revelation \"a distraction from the issues we are facing today.\" He said that his \"foolish\" words are much different than the words and actions of Bill Clinton, whom he accused of abusing women, and Hillary Clinton, whom he accused of having \"bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.\"\n\n\"I've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not. I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am,\" Trump said.\n\nIn an apparent response to Republican critics asking him to drop out of the race, he said: \"We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.\"\n\nThe tape includes audio of Bush and Trump talking inside the bus, as well as audio and video once they emerge from it to begin shooting the segment.\n\nIn that audio, Trump discusses a failed attempt to seduce a woman, whose full name is not given in the video.\n\n\"I moved on her, and I failed. I'll admit it,\" Trump is heard saying. It was unclear when the events he was describing took place. The tape was recorded several months after he married his third wife, Melania.\n\n\"I did try and f--- her. She was married,\" Trump says.\n\nTrump continues: \"And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, 'I'll show you where they have some nice furniture.'\"\n\n\"I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married,\" Trump says. \"Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. She's totally changed her look.\"\n\nAt that point in the audio, Trump and Bush appear to notice Arianne Zucker, the actress who is waiting to escort them into the soap-opera set.\n\n\"Your girl's hot as s---, in the purple,\" says Bush, who's now a co-host of NBC's \"Today\" show.\n\n\"I've got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,\" Trump says. \"You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful - I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait.\"\n\n\"And when you're a star, they let you do it,\" Trump says. \"You can do anything.\"\n\n\"Whatever you want,\" says another voice, apparently Bush's.\n\n\"Grab them by the p---y,\" Trump says. \"You can do anything.\"\n\n[In wake of debate, multiple women accuse Trump of sexual advances]\n\nA spokeswoman for NBC Universal, which produces and distributes \"Access Hollywood,\" declined to comment.\n\n\"This was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close,\" Trump said in a statement. \"I apologize if anyone was offended.\"\n\nBilly Bush, in a statement released by NBC Universal, said: \"Obviously I'm embarrassed and ashamed. It's no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago - I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry.\"\n\nAfter the video appeared online Friday afternoon, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter: \"This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.\" Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.), told reporters, \"It makes me sick to my stomach,\" while campaigning in Las Vegas.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund, which has endorsed Clinton, issued a statement from Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens saying: \"What Trump described in these tapes amounts to sexual assault.\"\n\nTrump was also criticized by members of his own party. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who said he is \"sickened\" by Trump's comments, said the Republican presidential candidate will no longer appear with him at a campaign event in Wisconsin on Saturday.\n\n\"Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,\" Ryan said in a statement.\n\nIn a short statement issued moments after Ryan's, Trump said his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, \"will be representing me\" at the Wisconsin event.\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), who is running for reelection and has said she will vote for Trump, called his comments \"totally inappropriate and offensive.\"\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has stood by Trump uncritically through numerous controversies, said in a statement: \"No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\"\n\nFormer presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a Trump critic, said in a statement: \"Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the comments are \"repugnant, and unacceptable in any circumstance\" and made clear Trump's brief statement would not suffice.\n\n\"As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape,\" he said late Friday.\n\nOne of Trump's most prominent social-conservative supporters, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, told BuzzFeed's Rosie Gray: \"My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values.\"\n\nTrump's running mate, Pence, was at a diner in Toledo when the news broke - about to view the diner's collection of signed cardboard hot-dog buns, which includes one signed by Trump. But the reporters traveling with Pence were quickly ushered out of the diner by campaign staff, before they could ask Trump's running mate about it, according to Politico. Politico reported that the journalists, traveling in Pence's \"protective pool,\" were not permitted to film Pence as he left the diner.\n\nThe tape appears at a time when Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has sought to make a campaign issue out of his opponent's marriage. Trump has criticized former president Bill Clinton for his past infidelity and criticized opponent Hillary Clinton as her husband's \"enabler.\"\n\n\"Hillary Clinton was married to the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics,\" Trump told the New York Times in a recent interview. \"Hillary was an enabler, and she attacked the women who Bill Clinton mistreated afterward. I think it's a serious problem for them, and it's something that I'm considering talking about more in the near future.\"\n\nTrump carried on a very public affair with Marla Maples - his eventual second wife - while still married to first wife Ivana Trump.\n\nTrump has been criticized in this campaign for derogatory and lewd comments about women, including some made on TV and live radio. In an interview Wednesday with KSNV, a Las Vegas television station, Trump said that those comments were made for entertainment.\n\n\"A lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment. There's nobody that has more respect for women than I do,\" he told the station.\n\n\"Are you trying to tone it down now?\" asked the interviewer, Jim Snyder.\n\n\"It's not a question of trying, it's very easy,\" Trump said.\n\nThe tape obtained by The Post seems to have captured Trump in a private moment, with no audience beyond Bush and a few others on the bus. It appears to have been shot around Sept.\u00a016, 2005, which was the day media reports said Trump would tape his soap-opera cameo.\n\nThe video shows the bus carrying Trump and Bush turning down a street on the studio back lot. The two men cannot be seen.\n\n\"Oof, get out of the way, honey,\" Bush says, apparently referencing somebody else blocking the view of Zucker.\n\nThe two men then exit the bus and greet Zucker.\n\n\"We're ready, let's go,\" Trump says, after the initial greetings. \"Make me a soap star.\"\n\n\"How about a little hug for the Donald?\" Bush says. \"He just got off the bus.\"\n\n\"Would you like a little hug, darling?\" Zucker says.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Trump says. As they embrace, and air-kiss, Trump says, \"Melania said this was okay.\"\n\nThe video then follows Trump, Bush and Zucker into the studio. Trump did appear on \"Days of Our Lives\" in late October. In a tape of that cameo posted online, Zucker's character asks Trump - playing himself - for a job at his business, and tells him suggestively, \"I think you'll find I'm a very willing employee. Working under you, I think, could be mutually beneficial.\"\n\nTrump's character gives her the brushoff.\n\n\"That's an interesting proposition,\" Trump says on-screen. \"I'll get back to you.\"\n\nA publicist for Zucker did not immediately respond to questions on Friday afternoon.\n\nRosalind S. Helderman, Mike DeBonis, Jenna Johnson and Sarah Parnass contributed to this report.\n\nAlso read: The 2016 electoral map is rapidly slilpping away from Donald Trump\n\nWhen news of Trump taxes broke, he went off onto angry tangents\n\n'Donald Trump will protect you': Some fear he's running to be a dictator\n",

    "text": "\nAs one of Variety\u2019s Power of Women honorees, Blake Lively will attend a lunch on Friday in support of Child Rescue Coalition. For this week\u2019s issue, the actress spoke about women in Hollywood, shooting in New York for \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d and what she looks for in a role.\n\nThere\u2019s been a national conversation recently about gender disparity in Hollywood. Have you experienced that? \n\n Yeah, I\u2019ve felt that. It\u2019s hard to complain when there are women who are being sex trafficked, women being treated as objects and product. Yes, it\u2019s important to have that conversation, because equality is equality. I feel fortunate. It\u2019s still to far from what it should be for women in 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that half the audience of ticket buyers are female. Are you interested in doing tentpoles?\n\n I don\u2019t look at movies by the budget. I look at movies by the character. What was neat about \u201cThe Shallows,\u201d it was really low budget. It was a $17 million movie and we did over $120 million worldwide. It\u2019s cool to do that with a story about a woman. It\u2019s proof people want to see movies about women. It doesn\u2019t all have to be Nicholas Sparks-type films. When you look at a \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise now versus the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise then, there are women at the center.\n\nDo you think there could be a sequel to \u201cThe Shallows\u201d?\n\n I don\u2019t know what would happen. I hope not; I\u2019m not ready to go work out like that again. I\u2019m about to do a movie in a couple months where I\u2019m playing a woman who is a fighter.\n\nHave you started boxing?\n\n I\u2019m not there yet. I\u2019m getting my back strong.\n\nWhat speaks to you in a script?\n\n I look for interesting women. It can be a woman in every frame of the movie or it could be a woman that\u2019s in one scene, but I look for characters that I connect with. Having a family and having worked on a show for six years, it really made me want to do work that I love. And it leads to greater success, which only means more opportunity to do that again.\n\nWould you ever want to direct? \n\n I\u2019m really drawn to it. I think I would do it later in life. It\u2019s two years and it becomes your baby. While my kids are young, I wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\n\nNetflix has been rebooting old TV shows. Do you think they could ever do a \u201cGossip Girl\u201d reunion?\n\n I don\u2019t know. Why not?\n\nYou\u2019d do a grown-up version with the cast? \n\n It sort of all depends. Would I do seven years of the show? No, because it\u2019s hard work and I\u2019ve got my babies, and I don\u2019t want to be away from them that much. But I\u2019ve just learned in life you never say never. I\u2019m looking to do something that I haven\u2019t done yet, not something that I did. But would I do that? Who knows \u2014 if it was good, if it made sense. We had so much fun shooting and living and working in New York City.\n\nThe show glamorized Manhattan for a post-\u201cSex and the City\u201d generation.\n\n Josh [Schwartz] and Stephanie [Savage] refused to do the show in Toronto. They said, \u201cNo, New York City is the star of the show.\u201d And so they fought for it to be made in New York. If we would have been in Toronto, I don\u2019t know if we would have made it past our first episode.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine the show being set in a fake New York.\n\n We were always in the coolest new spots. It was almost like a city guide as well as a fun show to watch. We were one of the first people to be at Sleep No More.\n\nWould you go back to TV?\n\n For me, it\u2019s about good content. My favorite new things I\u2019ve seen this year have been shows over movies, between \u201cThe OA\u201d and \u201cStranger Things.\u201d I finally watched all of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cWestworld.\u201d I love being an audience member of long-form story telling. I would only want to be in a show that I would want to watch.\n",

    "text": "\nAh, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. She, an Australian film fixture once married to Hollywood\u2019s leading man. He, an Australian country singer with a Nashville heart. Together they are a bi-coastal, bi-country, bi-continent power couple. Go on, watch them walk down any red carpet together and try to remain uncharmed. They\u2019re two charm factories who make distinctive hair choices! You have no chance! That\u2019s why when she won best actress for her electric Big Little Lies role, and kissed her television husband, the very tall Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, on the lips while her actual husband looked lovingly on, everyone was like, \u201cWhat? Huh? On the lips?\u201d\n\nFinally, we have some answers. Sort of. Well, Graham Norton of Britain\u2019s Graham Norton Show tried to get some answers, while Kidman sat next to her Killing of a Sacred Deer co-star Colin Farrell, who was next to Bryan Cranston, who was next to Matt Lucas. He didn\u2019t get answers, per se, but he did get some TV magic.\n\n\u201cI kissed my husband too,\u201d was her first tactic. And then, she said, \u201cI did kiss him because\u2014 but you gotta understand, I did everything with Alex,\" Nicole said.\n\n\u201cAlright I\u2019m backin\u2019 off,\u201d Kidman said. \u201cI\u2019ve got an amazing, supportive, gorgeous husband who I love more than anything in the world and I gave Alex a congratulatory kiss and he\u2019s like a mannequin.\u201d\n\nThe clip is charming. Kidman\u2019s charming. She, one of the most beautiful and accomplished women in the world, can\u2019t say the right thing no matter how hard she tries. She\u2019s awash is embarrassment, but also it feels so safe because the couple\u2014Kidman and Urban, that is\u2014appears to have so much love that that love bubbles up and over, turning an innocent congratulations into a kiss on the lips. There\u2019s enough to go around, it would seem.\n\nThis year, Kidman has developed a habit of doing a small thing at an award show that becomes a much bigger phenomenon on the Internet that night and the following day, and, in the case of the Skarsg\u00e5rd kiss, the subsequent weeks. She\u2019s a one-woman meme machine, and who could have seen that coming? Who could have thought that in 2017, Nicole Kidman would be the one bringing unintentional levity to long award shows? Anyone?\n\nOne of those small things was just being cute on the Cannes red carpet with her husband. (He whispered something, but we\u2019ll never know what it is. It\u2019s Lost in Translation 2: Still a Little Lost!) Another time she clapped like a seal at the Oscars. (It was a strategy, she explained, for showing appreciation while also protecting the diamonds.) We\u2019ll have to wait and see what kind of nominations Kidman racks up for the imminent awards season, but we can only hope the people in charge of seating charts place her firmly in front of a camera. She\u2019s a proven star in this new ad-hoc people\u2019s choice category.\n",

    "text": "\nFans think Taylor Swift and Drake are dating. \n\nThey're probably just making music together. \n\nThe truth can be a slippery thing.\n\n\n\n Let's get this out of the way right now: Taylor Swift and Drake are probably not dating. But according to some people, they are - and if true, it could be\u00a0huge news in the music business.\n\nThough there's little evidence to support the theory that Drake and Taylor are an item, people online have been conjecturing wildly. Here's what we\u00a0know.\n\nAt the stroke of midnight, on the evening of October 23, Drake\u00a0turned 30 years old. He hosted a big birthday party and, as celebrities do, had\u00a0a bunch of other celebrities and hanger-ons there.\n\n\"Taylor arrived with some friends and looked to be having fun,\" an anonymous source told E!. \"After dinner there was lots of dancing. At one point Drake and Taylor were seen near the DJ together talking, his arm over her shoulder for a minute like a real friend moment. It looked like they were talking about something deep.\"\n\nAt some point during the evening, \"everyone sang happy birthday to Drake,\" according to E!. Swift was presumably among the singers.\n\nDrake also introduced Swift to his mom,\u00a0according to TMZ. Swift and Drake\u00a0posed for a few photos, and that's the extent of their known contact that night.\n\nSo,\u00a0are they dating? Twitter users sure shipped them.\n\n\"Rihanna how do you feel about Drake and Taylor Swift dating?\"\n\n\n\n\ntaylor releases her version of lemonade 'pumpkin spice' - danny (@epDannyEdge) October 28, 2016 so drake and taylor swift are dating \n\n\n\npredictions:\n\n\n\ndrake cheats on taylor\n\n\n\ntaylor releases her version of lemonade 'pumpkin spice' - danny  (@epDannyEdge) October 28, 2016\n\ndrake and taylor swift already have a hilarious picture together that rivals all the pictures of hiddleswift pic.twitter.com/Ucs8IHi9pq - anu (@abeltesfayay) October 28, 2016\n\nWhen sources are saying things are starting to heat up between Drake and Taylor Swift but you ain't even know they were dating pic.twitter.com/7gbYe8yO3w - Orlando  (@Abelsxoxo) October 28, 2016\n\nCan't wait for Drake and Taylor Swift to break up and write albums dragging each other - Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) October 28, 2016\n\nOn November 2, as the dating rumors were flaring up, Page Six\u00a0came out with another report\u00a0that\u00a0the two were making music together. E! News confirmed the report:\n\nFor those surprised by the seemingly unlikely duo, our source reveals \"the music they have been working on is different,\" albeit \"very catchy.\" The insider adds, \"They've both been having a great time in the studio.\"\n\nThat means they're spending a lot of time together. Possibly alone. Possibly not. So they could be working on music together, and they could be hooking up. Who's to say?\n\nDrake has an impish, winking relationship with his fans. On \"Saturday Night Live,\" he once sang about how he's more than just\u00a0a meme. So later in November, he posted a\u00a0picture of himself and Swift together with the caption \"Is that velvet? \"\n\nA photo posted by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Nov 4, 2016 at 1:34am PDT\u00a0on\n\nOnce again, a general freak out occurred. The coy flower emoji seemed especially designed to make people wonder what on earth was happening.\n\nThe hip-hop artist released an ad where - in his self-aware persona - he sings along to Swift's \"Bad Blood.\"\n\nIt's a reference to a commercial Swift made a few months earlier, where she ran on a treadmill, and fell off it, while singing along to Drake and Future's \"Jumpman.\"\n\nAnd when Drake posted his ad on Instagram, he snuck in the hashtag \"#Draylor.\" Maybe it's a hashtag for the ad, maybe it's a hashtag for the two as a couple. Clearly, Swift and Drake\u00a0are friendly enough to make referential meta-jokes about one another.\n\nThe Swift-Drake relationship is less about actual evidence that they're dating and more about wish fulfillment and fun speculation. Fans don't believe the couple are dating as much as they want to will their relationship into existence.\n\nBut why does it hold so much appeal?\n\nFor her part, Swift recently ended a summer fling\u00a0with Tom Hiddleston.\u00a0That relationship was a strange fit. Swift is one of the biggest celebrities in the world. Hiddleston - though he is a fine actor, conventionally attractive, and still the best villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - is simply not on her level.\n\nApart from star power, Hiddleston, 35, always seemed so much older than\u00a0Swift, 26. For these reasons and more, Hiddleswift always made for a\u00a0slightly bizarre coupling to outsiders.\n\nMeanwhile, Drake has been in\u00a0an on-again-off-again relationship\u00a0with Rihanna for years. It arguably culminated in August when Drake professed his love for her on stage in the VMAs. But right now, they're off again.\n\nA Swift-Drake relationship would\u00a0distract the public from any image-altering breakups\u00a0and reestablish both of them as the desirable, \u00fcber talented A-listers they are.\n\nOf course, this\u00a0narrative could\u00a0just be publicity for their new song together. Even if Swift and Drake aren't in love, they're a match made in PR heaven.\n",

According to the website neither Pitt has any intention of introducing his children to Aniston, nor is the Friends actress keen on meeting the Pitt-Jolie brood.\n\nIn fact, the gossip debunking site noted that the speculative story is based on rumours of Pitt-Aniston's reunion, which itself are not true.\n\nThe site further claimed that Jolie did not have any outrageous demands like that of Pitt keeping his children away from Aniston.\n\nInTouch Weekly had quoted its source as saying, \"As Angie and Brad's divorce talks continue, she's demanding that Brad agree to never have their children around Jen.\"\n\nThe magazine mentioned that the Allied actor had been leaning on Aniston as he is going through his divorce from Jolie. Additionally, the report claimed that Pitt and Aniston had apparently reconciled and were exchanging messages.\n\nThe original report also shed light on Pitt's side of the story. \"Brad thinks the request is off the wall and irrational,\" the magazine quoted the source as saying. \"He isn't going to cave in to Angie's ridiculous demand... Angie is the one who filed for divorce, not him. And she will have to live with the consequences,\" the source claimed.\n\nJolie was last spotted along with four of her children in London, shopping for books.\n\nJolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016 and the couple are working on the custody of their children in private.\n",

Those moments were forever captured on camera for episodes of \"The Simple Life\" back in the mid-2000s.\n\nScreengrabs from these episodes have become very popular, but there's just one problem -- the captions are completely fake and your favorite Kim Kardashian meme is a fraud.\n\nHere's the conversation that actually took place on the episode:\n\nYep, that was a scene about giving a dog a pregnancy test.\n\nBut moving on, this gif with a caption of Hilton telling Kardashian to organize her closet is again also 100 percent fake.\n\nAnd while it may be fake, it may actually be better than the real conversation that was had in Paris' closet that day:\n\nParis: I love this closet, it's so good. \n\n Kim: What's going on with this?\n\n Paris: That's my 'If I ever go to India' outfit.\n\n Kim: Really?\n\n Paris: Yes.\n\n Kim: Are you planning on going?\n\n Paris: Yes, but don't you have to, like, cover up everything?\n\n Kim: You're not allowed to show any of your hair. It's like a law. \n\n Paris: Are you allowed to have blond hair? If you travel there do you really have to do this?\n\n Kim: I think so, or you'll get like shot or something. \n\n Paris: That's hot.\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint exactly where these screengrabs with fake captions originated, but multiple news outlets just assumed they were real, and the myth of Hilton as a demanding boss who desperately needed her closet organized only continued to grow. However, after learning what Hilton and Kardashian were really discussing at the time, the two might now be wishing the hotel heiress was actually ordering the future reality star to clean her closet.\n\nSo, if you want these memes to live on, use the right captions:\n",

I don't think I ever could give back as much as this country has given me.\"\n\nFirst They Killed My Father is based on a book of the same name by Loung Ung.\n\nMs Ung was five when she and her family were forced to leave their home in the capital, Phnom Penh, by the Khmer Rouge, the regime which ran the country between 1975 and 1979, under Pol Pot.\n\nIt is estimated that about two million people, around a quarter of the population, were either murdered by the regime or died from starvation and overwork.\n\n\"I thought that this war that happened 40 years ago, and what happened to these people, was not properly understood,\" said Jolie.\n\nThe film is predominantly in the local Khmer language, and Jolie said that while she wanted the wider world to better understand events in Cambodia she hoped it would have an impact domestically too.\n\n\"I hope it helps the country speak more,\" she said, as many survivors \"haven't told their children their story\".\n\nThe film, made by Netflix, was given its world premiere on Saturday inside the Angkor temple complex in Siem Reap, where Tomb Raider was partly filmed.\n\nAmong those present alongside Jolie and her six children was Cambodia's King Norodom Sihamoni, who in 2005 granted the actress Cambodian citizenship for the work done by an environmental foundation she established in the country.\n\nThe premiere was the first major public appearance for Jolie since she filed for divorce from Brad Pitt in September last year, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe couple had been together since 2004 but only married in August 2014.\n\n\"It was very difficult,\" Jolie said. \"Many people find themselves in this situation. My whole family have all been through a difficult time. My focus is my children, our children.\n\n\"We are and forever will be a family and so that is how I am coping. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.\"\n\nOscars 2017: what's up for best foreign language film?\n\nCambodia's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, on the back of a large garment sector producing clothes for some of the world's biggest brands.\n\nThe government of long-time Prime Minister Hun Sen, himself a former Khmer Rouge cadre, takes credit for providing peace and development, but is accused of using heavy-handed tactics and the courts to subdue political opponents.\n\nA UN-backed tribunal prosecuting senior Khmer Rouge leaders has convicted just a handful of people. Pol Pot died in 1998.\n\nJolie recently wrote a piece for the New York Times in response to US President Donald Trump's immigration ban, calling for her homeland to make decisions based on fact rather than fear.\n\nShe was reluctant to talk specifically about Mr Trump but said: \"The American people are bigger than any president. I suppose I have faith in my country and in what it is founded on and the values we hold dear.\n\n\"I believe that many of the things that we're hearing that we feel are based on a sense of spreading fear or hate or dividing people by race or judgement is un-American.\n\n\"At this time I think what is amazing is we are seeing people around the world start to speak out for their civil liberties and rights and what they feel. In America, we are hearing people say 'this is un-American to me, this is unconstitutional to me. And this is who I am'.\"\n",

    "text": "\nJust over one week ago, Drake surprised the world by announcing a new single was on its way, and then by dropping said track just a few days later in the middle of a Louis Vuitton runway show in Paris. For those who didn\u2019t get an invite to the exclusive event, \u201cSigns\u201d was uploaded to Spotify shortly thereafter, and since then it's been streamed millions of times and discussed at length across social channels.\n\nThe new Drake track sounds like it could be the next big hit for the hip-hop superstar, who obviously wants to own the summer in the same way he did last year with his first No. 1 hit as a lead artist, \u201cOne Dance.\u201d \u201cSigns\u201d has yet to hit the Hot 100, but it will in a short time, and it could grant the rapper another serious smash.\n\nMany people have started wondering what the release of this new poppy offering means for Drake, who is only a few months removed from his last chart-topping effort on the Billboard 200. As always, he has been mum on the subject, but there is plenty of precedent in his past to suggest that a new collection could already be in the works from the biggest name in music.\n\nOver the past few years, Drake has sped up his release schedule, and he never allows much time to pass in between one album and the next (or whatever he\u2019s calling them these days). He dropped two mixtapes in 2015, an album in 2016 and less than a year later in March 2017, his playlist project More Life topped the albums tally with ease. All of those items were massive moments in music and successful in terms of sales and especially streams, and while he could have kept them alive and promoted them more intensely, Drake doesn\u2019t seem concerned with the shelf life of his music, instead focusing his energy on creating more and more content.\n\nIt might only be a few months old, but the superstar Grammy winner seems to have already moved on from More Life, even though it remains inside the top 10 on the Billboard week after week. He hasn\u2019t gone out of his way to do much in the way of promotion, and while every track featured on the collection initially charted on the Hot 100, only two have managed to hold on, and neither is currently residing inside the top 40 any longer.\n\nDrake also has a habit of mixing timelines and pushing more than one project simultaneously, which would likely be disastrous for any other artist. Back in July 2015, he unleashed \u201cHotline Bling,\u201d which would quickly go on to become one of his highest-charting efforts and something of a signature song. Just a\u00a0few months later, he and Future dropped their collaborative mixtape What A Time To Be Alive, which confusingly didn\u2019t feature \u201cBling.\u201d That song wouldn\u2019t end up on a collection until nine months later, when Views finally conquered the world. The name Drake turned out to be powerful enough to keep both the song going and to send\u00a0What A Time To Be Alive to the top of the Billboard 200 without issue, so now he knows he can balance two different projects at once.\n\nAt the moment, \u201cSigns\u201d is currently being pushed as a standalone single, but in Drake\u2019s world, that could change in a moment. Depending on how well it performs on the charts and how long it is able to last, it could wind up serving as the lead cut from an upcoming album, or mixtape, or playlist project or anything really. Drake has established himself as not only one of the most successful artists of all time, but also one of the most unpredictable, which is what is required by today\u2019s fast-paced music industry.\n",

The outlet noted a fourth coach for that season has not yet been confirmed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited to join \u2018The Voice\u2019 at NBC,\u201d Clarkson said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going back and forth with them for years on joining their team and the timing hasn\u2019t been right until now. Ever since NBC and I worked together on my Christmas special years ago we have established an amazing relationship and I have always loved coming on to either mentor, or perform on \u2018The Voice\u2019 over the years.

She is single and enjoys dating,\" said that source, who described Lopez as \"excited.\"\n\nThe actress-singer-dancer, 47, and the newly full-time Fox Sports broadcaster, 41, are said to be headed for a \"romantic\" vacation in the Bahamas soon with another couple, the Terez Owens sports-gossip blog reported Monday.\n\n\"He was with her in Vegas during this latest leg of her Planet Hollywood Vegas show,\" LoveBScott.com reported Wednesday. \"They were all coupled up behind the scenes, not public, but absolutely not hiding their relationship around close friends and family. It is definitely for real.\"\n\nRodriguez,\u00a0who played his final Major League Baseball game in August, took a full-time analyst job Tuesday with Fox Sports, where he previously had\u00a0been killing it as a guest host teamed with Pete Rose.\n\nOf course, Lopez's outings with Drake had dating rumors swirling earlier this year\u00a0too, though she put the kibosh on that for real Monday night, telling Trevor Noah ,\u00a0\"Let me clear this up:\u00a0I am not with Drake.\"\n\nRodriguez and Lopez each have two kids from previous relationships. His daughters are 8 and 12; her twin son and daughter recently turned 9. A-Rod was\u00a0married once, while JLo is a three-time divorcee.\n",

    "text": "Since the news of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's split, many have wondered what will happen to the couple's six kids. Will they stay with mom, or with dad, or some combination of the two? Or could a third person have parenting rights as well? Enter Mark Billingham, the star couple's bodyguard. Billingham said he basically \"fathered\" the children, according to Us Weekly.\n\nOf course, Billingham is not asking for custody \u2014 and even if he did, he probably wouldn't be awarded it, considering he's not related by blood to the kids, and he was only with the family for 18 months. But it's interesting that the guard would choose to come forward with the details of his employments now, especially amidst some rumors of Pitt's shortcomings as a father.\n\nAccording to Billingham, the couple's primary concern was their children. They wanted the guard to keep the six kids \u2014 Maddox, 15; Pax, 12; Zahara, 11; Shiloh, 10; and 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne \u2014 safe, particularly from kidnapping.\n\nA former member of the British army, Billingham described the couple's intense protectiveness of their children. Pitt and Jolie didn't want the kids spending time or going anywhere with strangers. They were also worried about stalkers who could endanger the lives of their children, according to The Sun. But Billingham said he was was one member of their staff that the couple allowed to get close to the kids, according to the Sun:\n\nBillingham said he became so close with the kids that he was an \"unofficial\" father. But he didn't throw any shade at Pitt, whose parenting style some questioned after Jolie filed for divorce. E! News reported that Pitt was under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Department of Children and Family Services as a result of allegations that the actor verbally and physically abused the children. The allegations have not been substantiated.\n\nFrom what Billingham describes of his relationship to the couple and their children, it's clear that Pitt and Jolie want what's best for their children. In her divorce filing, Jolie did cite the well-being of the kids as a reason for the split. Pitt, in his response, also emphasized his commitment to the couple's children. Hopefully, with the right support system \u2014 perhaps including people like Billingham \u2014 the kids will get through the divorce alright.\n",

    "text": "\nIt's been a busy October so far with pet rescue events seemingly popping up all over the greater Los Angeles area.\n\nI've been fortunate enough to work with Emmy award-winning actress Jane Lynch to help animals and people in need through K9s for Warriors and The Rescue Train (see Glee' Star Jane Lynch Helps Place Dogs with PTSD Soldiers and Actress Jane Lynch Raises Awareness for Pets in Need).\n\nThe star power at my next pet-rescue event was just taken up a notch at the 2nd annual fundraiser for the\u00a0Saving SPOT! Rescue.\n\nThe\u00a0SPOT!\u00a0storefront from which the rescue operates, is the impassioned business of Lizzie Scherer. She and her family and staff work tirelessly to help ensure that dogs up for adoption are healthy and placed in suitable forever homes.\u00a0The event\u00a0was held at the Thomson Hotel in Beverly Hills, CA.\n\nMedia icon Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, lent their luminous presence to the cause by hosting the live auction where they auctioned off the opportunity to travel on a Toms shoes and eyewear\u00a0trip to deliever shoes to children. The\u00a0jovial and convincing nature of Degeneres brought the value of the auction item up to over $8,000, all of which was ultimately donated to Saving SPOT! Rescue.\n\nDeGeneres has supported the Saving Spot! Rescue for years and even features the rescue's adoptable dogs on her EllenTV.com website. Recently, she posted\u00a0profiles of English Cocker Spaniels hilariously named Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha after HBO's Sex and the City.\n\nPresent at the SPOT! event were a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors of cute dogs in need of adoption. Degeneres and De Rossi were photographed holding the puppies and were particularly drawn to a petite puppy having a jet-black coat.\n\nDid DeGeneres and de Rossi take another pooch home to add to their growing number of canine and feline family members? I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that the couple already cares for Mabel, a black Standard Poodle, and Wolf, a mixed breed suspected to be a hybrid of Poodle-Maltese.\n\nAlthough Mabel is a pure-breed dog, she was reportedly rescued from a less-than-ideal living environment. According to an interview with peoplepets.com (EXCLUSIVE! Ellen DeGeneres Chats About Her Pets), Mabel \"was kind of a show dog early in her career, and, like many models, got too old for it. She was in a kennel, she was not needed anymore so we got her from this guy. She was definitely not in a horrible situation; she was in a situation where she needed a home.\"\n\nWolf also has a unique rescue story, as DeGeneres says, \"I wasn't looking for a dog. I happened to spot a man that was not completely balanced. He was a guy that was mistreating the dog. He was swinging the dog around and doing things to it and I went over to him and offered to give him some money. It was a long, long story but the guy was very strange and had smuggled the dog in from Mexico and was not planning on doing things to it, so it took me hours to get that dog from that guy. Anyway, Wolf was in pretty bad shape. He was tiny ... he was [malnourished], he couldn't stand up. His back legs couldn't support him because he had never been put down and maybe damaged on the way in, being smuggled in. It's just the craziest story. But he's just the craziest, sweetest dog now. Just a love!\"\n\nCats are also part of the family and have the unique names Chairman, Charlie, and George. \"Charlie has a dog personality where she has to be wherever people are and follow you from room to room,\" according to DeGeneres.\n\nA variety of other celebrities were also on hand to support Saving SPOT! Rescue, including:\n\nI had a very pleasant conversation with actress Allison Janney, who I met a few years back at a Los Angeles dog park after she showed interest in my dog Cardiff. After reminding her of our meeting, Janney told me all about the canine companions with whom she shares her home. Hopefully, I'll soon be caring for her dogs as my patients.\n\nThe night wrapped up with happy humans having congregated for a good cause and raised lots of money to help support the ongoing efforts of Saving Spot! Rescue.\n\nAre you involved in an animal rescue cause? Please feel free to share your experiences in canine or feline rescue in the comments section.\n",

Simpson was guilty of killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman is making waves.\n\nAccording to Radar Online, which obtained an exclusive copy of the book, Jenner talks about a car ride she took with Kardashian in the 1990s following Simpson's civil trial and claims he said, \"I would've been okay with it if they had gotten him in the first trial.\" The implication, as Jenner goes on to explain, \"was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty.\"\n\nEven so, as one of the three members of Simpson's defense team, and a good friend of the Hall of Fame football and movie star, Jenner asks herself if Robert Kardashian's decision to continue defending Simpson was his way of getting revenge against his ex-wife Kris Jenner because he knew it would upset her. Kris married Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner in 1991 months after her divorce from Robert Kardashian. Kris Jenner also considered Nicole Brown Simpson one of her best friends.\n\n\"I wonder if it was his way of saying to [Kris] what I think she was saying to him when she married me: a big fuck you,\" Jenner reportedly writes.\n\nJenner reportedly goes on to call Simpson \"the most narcissistic, egocentric, neediest asshole in the world of sports I had ever seen\" and say he got away with \"two savage murders.\" According to Radar Online, Jenner also forbade her stepdaughters from saying Simpson's name in the house after Kourtney Kardashian said \"I told you he didn't do it!\" when he was found not guilty by the jury in 1995.\n",

Rumor has it that's the case.\n\nThe word on Jennifer Aniston's new movie set is that the 44-year-old doesn't socialize with her co-stars and whenever possible distances herself in her remote trailer, RadarOnline exclusively reports.\n\n\"Every day at lunch the entire cast and crew head to a cafeteria facility where they all sit down and eat lunch together for well over an hour,\" a source told RadarOnline. \"But the only person who doesn't eat with everyone else is Jen. She quickly grabs a lunch to go and leaves.\"\n\nAccording to RadarOnline's source, Aniston also gets a fancier SUV than everyone else's (including fellow stars Isla Fisher and Tim Robbins) and her trailer is situated way off set. All of these things make her seem \"not approachable,\" according to RadarOnline. But we can't help but wonder ... Is she being a obnoxious, or is she really just trying to hide a pregnancy?\n\nThink about it: Pregnancy gives you weird cravings but also nausea (hence the lonesome lunches), and perhaps she doesn't want to undress in front of others who can catch a glimpse of her baby bump. Or maybe we're just really, really wishful thinkers.\n\nEither way, this is not the first time Aniston has had \"diva\" rumors attached to her. A year and a half ago she admitted to throwing a chair at a director (!) but for a worthy cause: The man treated the script supervisor poorly and Jen later explained she couldn't stand aside and let him go on with it.\n",

The new couple discuss everything from their nerve-racking first date to the \u201creveals\u201d that forged their bond.\n\n\u2018It was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldn\u2019t normally do,\u201d says Jennifer Lopez, explaining how she and retired Yankee superstar Alex Rodriguez, who made their red-carpet debut as a couple last spring at the Met Gala, came to be a modern Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio\u2014that is, if Monroe and DiMaggio had been happy, highly functional fortysomethings who had apparently done battle with their demons and emerged the victors. It was last winter as she was having lunch in Beverly Hills that she saw Rodriguez walk by. \u201cI almost yelled out \u2018Alex,\u2019 but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that,\u201d she says. When she went outside, he was still there, facing away from her. \u201cI could literally just have walked away,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say \u2018Hey.\u2019 \u201cI had just come from a promo for my show, Shades of Blue [in which she plays N.Y.P.D. detective Harlee Santos], so I\u2019m dressed like my character, like a boy\u2014Timberlands, jeans, curly short hair. He looks at me. I say, \u2018It\u2019s Jennifer.\u2019 He says, \u2018You look so beautiful.\u2019 \u201d She and I are sitting on a stone patio at Lopez\u2019s new house in Bel Air, overlooking an infinity pool and a lush green lawn with a double-size swing, which she points out is perfect for her nine-year-old twins, Emme and Max. The house is light-filled, sprawling, and warm, with wood-beamed ceilings, stone walls, plush low-slung sofas, big pillows, bowls filled with cut roses, and artwork by collagist Peter Tunney. \u201cGRATTITUD\u018e,\u201d one piece spells out. It\u2019s a portmanteau of \u201cgratitude\u201d and \u201cattitude\u201d that could define Lopez. Wearing a cropped turtleneck sweater, skinny jeans, high Christian Louboutin boots, and impressive diamond earrings, she is as startlingly beautiful at 48 as she was at 28\u2014if not more so. \u201cWe walked into this house, and I said, \u2018This is where I want my kids to grow up,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cYou have to imagine your life, and what you want to be in it, and I imagined we would be very happy here no matter what.\u201d\n\nHappy, naturally, has turned out differently from what she imagined. Just hours after Rodriguez met her in Beverly Hills, he called her, and they agreed to have dinner a few nights later. She told him that she remembered meeting him on a baseball diamond, 12 years earlier. Her then husband, Marc Anthony, had thrown out the first pitch of a New York Mets game, but the cameras captured Lopez and Rodriguez shaking hands and locking eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say you remember if you don\u2019t,\u201d she told him. \u201cShea Stadium, during a subway series,\u201d he responded. Just then, Rodriguez walks out of the house to join us on the patio. \u201cI was telling her about the tap,\u201d she says to him. \u201cBut there were two taps,\u201d he says. She turns to me. \u201cThere was another very significant tap on the shoulder,\u201d she says. Before we get to that tap, we talk about their first date, when they met for dinner at the Hotel Bel Air. \u201cHe was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!\u201d she says. \u201cI think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I\u2019m not. I just listen. So he\u2019s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn\u2019t normally talk about on a first date. I don\u2019t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. Then I knew he was nervous because he asked me if I wanted a drink. I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t drink,\u2019 and he asked if I minded if he had one. He was nervous, and it was really cute.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it was a date,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cMaybe we were seeing each other at night because of her work schedule. I went in uneasy, not knowing her situation.\u201d He continues: \u201cIt would be incredibly productive for me to sit with one of the smartest, greatest women in the world, especially for a guy like me who is coming through tough times, rehabbing himself, re-establishing himself to folks out there. I thought it would be a win-win no matter what.\u201d Then: \u201cShe told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to get up and go re-adjust my thoughts. I went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m sitting there and he\u2019s walking back, and I get a text,\u201d Lopez continues. \u201cIt says . . . \u201d She looks significantly at Rodriguez. \u201cYou can tell her!\u201d he says. \u201c \u2018You look sexy AF,\u2019 \u201d she tells me. They both laugh. \u201cAnd then it took a turn,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cThe fire alarm went off, and we had to evacuate.\u201d I laugh, thinking she\u2019s being metaphorical. \u201cNo, really,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fire alarm went off!\u201d\n\nBut about that other tap. This one was metaphorical. In August 2016, when Rodriguez announced his retirement from baseball, with his mother and his daughters Natasha and Ella in the stands, four runs short of 700 home runs, he said, \u201cBaseball has a funny way of tapping you on the shoulder when you least expect it and telling you that it\u2019s the end.\u201d It\u2019s a year later, and now, he says, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about one door closing and another opening, and if that first door doesn\u2019t close, well, there isn\u2019t that second tap.\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s story about the tap is a poignant reminder that this isn\u2019t just another love story. It\u2019s the story of two people with rich and at times tumultuous pasts, which are part of the reason they have a present as a couple. \u201cWe are very much twins,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re both Leos; we\u2019re both from New York; we\u2019re both Latino and about 20 other things.\u201d \u201cI understand him in a way that I don\u2019t think anyone else could, and he understands me in a way that no one else could ever,\u201d she says. \u201cIn his 20s, he came into big success with the biggest baseball contract [at the time]. I had a No. 1 movie and a No. 1 album and made history. We both had ups and downs and challenges in our 30s, and by our 40s we\u2019d both been through so much. And more importantly than anything, we had both done a lot of work on ourselves.\u201d Lopez, whose parents came from Puerto Rico, grew up in the Bronx, where she shared a bedroom with her two sisters. She famously left home at 18 to make it as a dancer, and burst on the scene in 1991 as one of the Fly Girls on Fox\u2019s In Living Color, the hit comedy series. She quickly parlayed her luminous beauty, talent, and sheer workaholism into a series of starring roles, including Marisa in Maid in Manhattan, which grossed more than $150 million worldwide. Of their first date Lopez recalls, \u201cI don\u2019t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. . . . He was nervous, and it was really cute.\u201d Being a movie star wasn\u2019t enough for Lopez. She also released a string of hit albums and became a fashion icon. In 2003, she signed a lucrative endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton. \u201cNow it\u2019s odd if you\u2019re a celebrity and you don\u2019t serve as the spokesperson for a brand,\u201d says Benny Medina, her longtime manager, whom Lopez credits with seeing the potential of celebrities as brands long before it was commonplace. \u201cBut back then there were plenty of snarky comments.\u201d In 2013, Lopez was granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the following year she became the first female artist to receive a Billboard Icon Award; her net worth has been estimated at more than $300 million. \u201cThere are people who put their feet in other people\u2019s footsteps,\u201d says Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, who was once Lopez\u2019s agent and is now a partner in her production company. \u201cJennifer had no footsteps in front of her, so much of the terrain had to be forged.\u201d\n\nThere was a cost, Lopez learned. \u201cWhen you have that type of success at a young age you have to navigate it, almost survive it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the first Latin actress to ever make $1 million from a role, and you feel, Oh God, I have to do something great all the time.\u201d There were the inevitable flops (most prominently Gigli, her movie with then boyfriend Ben Affleck) and three failed marriages, the last of which was with Marc Anthony, the father of her twins. And so her story isn\u2019t just about astounding achievement but also about personal growth and resilience. \u201cI was eviscerated,\u201d she recalls about the press on Gigli. \u201cI lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship [with Affleck] self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.\u201d She has also conquered what was once her biggest fear: being alone. Last August, she broke up with dancer Casper Smart in an effort to learn how. \u201cShe\u2019s a seeker,\u201d says her close friend Leah Remini, the actress and anti-Scientology activist. \u201cShe\u2019s always trying to improve herself, her relationships, be a better friend, a better daughter, a better mother, a better person. She\u2019s not closed-minded.\u201d If self-doubt and self-reflection aren\u2019t what you\u2019d expect from a diva, it\u2019s striking how little diva there is to Lopez these days. Goldsmith-Thomas, who, in 2004, was diagnosed with Stage Three breast cancer, recalls that Lopez would show up for her chemo appointments. \u201cShe made me very popular on the chemo ward!,\u201d Goldsmith says. \u201cShe\u2019d bring clothing for everyone from her Sweetface line and she\u2019d rub my bald head and talk about dreams. It was really important to talk about the future because she wanted me to know there was one. That girl saved my life.\u201d Rodriguez tells me that Lopez is happiest at home, in pj\u2019s, eating chocolate-chip cookies with friends. She and Rodriguez like to talk in terms of \u201creveals\u201d: the unexpected moments that tell you who someone else is. An early one for him, he says, was discovering that Lopez was \u201cthe role model for health and wellness. She rarely drinks. She tries to get at least eight hours of sleep.\u201d He adds, \u201cThat helps explain why she\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d She\u2019s also been willing to take risks to stay relevant, no easy task in a world where female stars are widely believed to have an expiration date. In 2010, she agreed to become a judge on American Idol, which some people derided as a comedown. But it worked. \u201cViewers who knew only an attention-grabbing siren met a hardworking, self-made, empathetic single mother,\u201d observed Forbes. \u201cNo one from my team wanted me to do American Idol except Benny,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cBut I felt I had something to offer, and in the back of my mind, I thought, Maybe people will get to know me a little bit better.\u201d She adds, \u201cWith reality TV, you can\u2019t hide who you are. You just can\u2019t. It\u2019s going to come through.\u201d\n\nAs Lopez was becoming J.Lo, so Alex Rodriguez was becoming A-Rod. He was just 18 and the youngest player in the league when he made his debut with the Mariners, in July 1994. He turned in a series of impressive stats that galvanized the baseball world\u2014like becoming the youngest player to hit 500 home runs. For the 2001 season, he was offered a record-breaking 10-year $252 million contract by the Texas Rangers. In 2004, Rodriguez was traded to the New York Yankees, and in 2007 he negotiated another 10-year deal. Like Lopez, Rodriguez is not a child of privilege. He too was born in New York City. When Alex was eight, his parents, immigrants from the Dominican Republic, moved the family to Miami, where his mother became a secretary in an immigration office and waited tables at night. When he was 10, his dad moved out of the house. As with Lopez, success made him feel not comfort and security but a near-desperate drive to succeed even more. (And you can see how questions such as CAN ALEX RODRIGUEZ PROVE HE\u2019S WORTH $252 MILLION? would foster that attitude in a young athlete.) \u201cMy No. 1 goal was to give R.O.I. [return on investment] to owners who believed in me,\u201d he recalls. In 2008, his marriage to Cynthia Scurtis, with whom he had daughters Natasha and Ella, broke up, due to his relationship with Madonna, and his dates with stars from Kate Hudson to Cameron Diaz became tabloid fodder. Plus, there were the injuries: two major hip surgeries, two knee surgeries. \u201cWe\u2019re both like this,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cWe put so much pressure on ourselves to be great, to be the best all the time. We understood that about each other. When we came together it was \u2018Oh my God, I was the same way.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRodriguez\u2019s career was ultimately sidelined by the steroid scandal, which rocked Major League Baseball in the mid-2000s. Rodriguez had earlier admitted using performance-enhancing drugs during his time with the Rangers, but adamantly denied he\u2019d continued the practice while with the Yankees. After a protracted fight with both the Yankees and the M.L.B., Rodriguez was suspended for an entire season\u2014one of the largest penalties in baseball history\u2014in early 2014. \u201cI was hoping the suspension would be shorter,\u201d he says today. \u201cI remember when Tony Clark, the head of our union, called me and said, \u2018It\u2019s a full season\u2014it\u2019s 162 [games],\u2019 it was a knife to my ribs.\u201d Rodriguez says he didn\u2019t leave his house for seven days. \u201cI thought I\u2019d played my last game. I grew a beard\u2014as much as I can grow it\u2014and didn\u2019t want to see anyone, including my kids.\u201d I ask him what he learned during that year. \u201cDo you have enough time?\u201d he asks. As he talks, Lopez nestles into him. \u201cI started brushing myself off, thinking, How do I come back into the world?\u201d he says. The year off, he realized, could give him the chance to heal not just his body but also his mind. \u201cI felt I could work on myself, understand why I kept making mistakes. . . . In a weird way, 2014 will be the best thing that ever happened to me. It forced a paradigm shift.\u201d He continues: \u201cI remember thinking one night . . . Don\u2019t know if I told you this, babe [he says to Lopez] . . . In the middle of this craziness, I remember it\u2019s three A.M., four A.M., and like many nights, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m not a crier, but I\u2019m bawling. . . . My pillows are now soaking wet, and it\u2019s the middle of the night, and I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m the only fucking asshole that gets pocket aces and figures out a way to lose the hand. I was so angry at myself, so pissed off, that it was hard to breathe.\u201d \u201cHow did you get through?\u201d I ask. \u201cHelp,\u201d he says. \u201cThe work I did, that was one of the most painful and most rewarding experiences of my life, and it continues to this day. I tell myself, \u2018I\u2019m rounding first base and going to second base. It\u2019s a process.\u2019 \u201d He says he decided to do like Rocky Balboa, to try to make the team \u201cas a broken-down 40-year-old that didn\u2019t have a lot of allies.\u201d And he succeeded, finishing the season with 33 home runs. \u201cI did that at 40 and 100 percent clean, and no one can take that away from me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt told me everything about who I was.\u201d When he retired, he agreed to stay on as an adviser to Yankee owner Hal Steinbrenner and as a mentor to younger players. \u201cFrom where I came from, that honor is like hitting 800,\u201d he says. This, to Lopez, was a reveal. \u201cThe most impressive thing to me was how he did pick himself up and take that opportunity to make himself a better person,\u201d she says. \u201cThe hardest times prove who you are. That\u2019s what I love and admire the most about Alex. He doesn\u2019t let anything beat him. He just comes back stronger.\u201d Each believes that if they had been single when they met, 12 years ago, the relationship wouldn\u2019t have worked. \u201cWe had to grow and discover ourselves first,\u201d she says. But it also works for another reason. As Goldsmith-Thomas says, \u201cThey weren\u2019t afraid to dream, and they are still dreaming, both of them.\u201d\n\nThe next night, Lopez is performing her smash show All I Have in Las Vegas. Onstage, she moves seamlessly from the best kind of sexy\u2014with a sense of humor\u2014to a festive Latin-inspired segment, to an utterly moving testimonial to her children, in which she sings Lee Ann Womack\u2019s \u201cI Hope You Dance.\u201d She\u2019s an incandescent performer, partly because, as Remini says, \u201cthere is nothing Jennifer does that she does half-assed. When she is in a project, she is in it, devouring it.\u201d \u201cA-Rod\u2019s in the house,\u201d someone from the audience yells. She laughs. Yes, A-Rod is in the house. Although he\u2019s seen the show many times, he\u2019s still watching every detail. He nudges me, pointing out a middle-aged woman in a pink pantsuit dancing ecstatically to \u201cJenny from the Block.\u201d Then he points out a gay couple in the front row practically swooning after one gets to touch Lopez\u2019s feet. During a segment that\u2019s all New York, with Lopez in a sequined baseball jersey, he nudges me again. \u201cIf you look closely, you\u2019ll see what number she\u2019s wearing on her jersey,\u201d he says. It\u2019s 13, his Yankee number. He says, \u201cWe are very much twins.\u201d She says, \u201cI understand him in a way that I don\u2019t think anyone else could.\u201d Earlier that day, she and Rodriguez were in Los Angeles at the premiere event for this season\u2019s Shark Tank, in which Rodriguez will be the first Latino shark. At a panel where the sharks discussed the show, the investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban says, \u201cA lot of us were pleasantly surprised that when Alex came in, he knew his stuff cold.\u201d During the red-carpet interviews, Lopez, who is impossibly glamorous in a floor-length tweed coat and aviator sunglasses, hangs at the back of the crowd. \u201cDoes it feel weird to be in the background?\u201d I ask. \u201cNoooo,\u201d she says. \u201cI like it. Because I\u2019m out there enough. Some people, it wouldn\u2019t work\u2014they can\u2019t stand not being the one in the spotlight. But not us.\u201d\n\nTheir story is also a merger of business empires. Lopez, who back in 2002\u2014way before everyone else was becoming an entrepreneur\u2014launched her fragrance Glow by J.Lo, now has a big portfolio of business interests, which range from her production company to sprawling property holdings. Rodriguez seems to slot right into her world. From a young age, he sought out mentors who could help him build a business that would one day replace his baseball income. During his suspension year, he took investing classes at Columbia and marketing classes at the University of Miami. Today, A-Rod Corp is an investment firm focused on a broad array of industries, including real estate, sports and wellness, media, and entertainment. \u201cI don\u2019t have your traditional formal education,\u201d he says. \u201cMine comes through reading and passion and grit and collecting a lot of information from my mentors. I\u2019ve never been afraid to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know. Can you explain that to me?\u2019 That\u2019s echoed by hedge-fund billionaire Marc Lasry, who has invested with Rodriguez for the last decade. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about Alex is that he\u2019s a sponge,\u201d Lasry says. \u201cHe really wants to learn.\u201d Another mentor of sorts is Mary Callahan Erdoes, the C.E.O. of J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, who met Rodriguez around the time that Lasry did. \u201cYou might be expecting something different,\u201d she says. \u201cBut from the first day, he had his notebook out. He\u2019s incredibly curious and serious. There\u2019s no nonsense and no pomp and circumstance.\u201d That\u2019s true to this day, Erdoes says, whether he\u2019s attending a JPMorgan-hosted conference on Brexit or a meeting with a hedge-fund manager. \u201cHe sits in the front of the room with his notebook out and his hand up, asking questions,\u201d she says. Rodriguez\u2019s innate curiosity\u2014about business, about other people, about fresh concepts\u2014makes him stand out in a world where many people lack that trait. \u201cThe real reason people do deals with Alex is that they like him and he\u2019s smart,\u201d says Lasry.\n\nThe day after I saw Lopez\u2019s show in Las Vegas, we meet at one of Rodriguez\u2019s latest investments, which he discovered when he was looking for a place to work out in Las Vegas\u2014members of Lopez\u2019s crew had raved about it. Called TruFusion, it offers more than 65 styles of instruction and 35 to 40 daily classes in yoga, Pilates, kettlebell exercises, and battle-rope workouts in heated rooms. Last June, Rodriguez purchased a major stake in the company, and now owns the development rights for all of Florida. President and C.O.O. Jonathan Fornaci says the classes can be so hard that he sees some professional athletes take breaks during them, but \u201cAlex kills it. And immediately afterward he\u2019s drilling down, asking questions that any private-equity analyst would be asking.\u201d I\u2019m warned that the \u201cDown N Dirty Bootcamp\u201d will be hard and sweaty, and it is precisely as advertised. At one point, confused by the welter of instructions\u2014Left! Right! Kettlebell! Weight! Sandbag!\u2014I look over at Lopez and roll my eyes in desperation. \u201cI get confused, too,\u201d she says. \u201cJust watch everyone else.\u201d During some particularly brutal leg lifts, I give up. She does not. In fact, she starts singing. At the end, we\u2019re all sitting on our mats, drenched in sweat and exhausted. Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u201d\u2019 is playing.\n\nIt\u2019s clear as day that neither of them is hitting Pause. After Vegas, she\u2019s off to New York, where her children are in school, and he\u2019s off to Atlanta, where he\u2019s filming a pilot for a CNBC reality show that will help retired athletes who are struggling financially. Rodriguez says he keeps himself grounded with some key words: \u201cGratitude and appreciation. When someone offers me a job, I thank the Lord that I have work, and I beg for more work.\u201d And he adds, \u201cWe\u2019re really good at reminding each other.\u201d They begin to tell me a story, one in which Lopez is in the bath, and Rodriguez is sitting by the fire in a robe. Looking at my face, he starts laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Where are you going with this story, and is it going to get R-rated?\u2019 \u201d But it\u2019s not R-rated, not at all. He says he got hot from the fire and went to sit on the patio outside their room, with a book and his feet up, in the crisp air. Lopez breaks in. \u201cI came out and said, \u2018What are you doing out here?\u2019 He said, \u2018Living the dream.\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s clear from the story that he said it in a way that was free of irony. \u201cI thought, Wow, this person is different,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cBecause a lot of people I\u2019ve met in my life, they don\u2019t appreciate what they\u2019re doing and how amazing it is . . . not the greatness of the house, but the moment of sitting there with someone you love, with a family, with healthy kids.\u201d All over the house are pictures of their four children as one family; when I ask Rodriguez which of his businesses he\u2019s most passionate about, he responds, without missing a beat, \u201cMy daughters.\u201d\n\nAs we drive from TruFusion to a little restaurant in a Vegas strip mall called Greens and Proteins, they say that early in their relationship they\u2019d text each other using the hashtag #bloodinbloodout, after the Mexican gangster film that is in some ways about the unbreakable ties of family. At the restaurant, a few people turn and stare, but mostly we\u2019re ignored, probably because no one can quite believe it\u2019s them. He\u2019s in workout clothes; she\u2019s wearing a cropped pink sweatshirt, no makeup, and has her hair pulled back in a bun. When we sit down, Rodriguez asks what surprised me the most about spending time with them. I answer that I was surprised, even shocked, by their genuine interest in other people. But when I walked behind them as they left TruFusion, their hands were touching and they were talking intently. It was normal and natural and easy. And that\u2019s an even better answer: I\u2019m most surprised to see that, out of two often surreal lives, they are managing to make one wonderfully real life. Our essential brief on culture, the news, and more. And it's on the house.\n",

A potential Spice Girls reunion with all five members is one of them.\n\nEarlier this morning, news broke that the most iconic girlband of all time may be reuniting in 2018, sending chills down the spines of every 90s girl power advocate up and down the country.\n\nAccording to the Independent, Mel C has reportedly been working quietly with the band's former boss Simon Fuller over the past few months to bring Victoria Beckham, Mel B, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner (n\u00e9e Halliwell) back for the one-off special, with a compilation record expected to land next year.\n\nA source told The Sun: 'The five of them have been locked in secret talks since the summer, and finally they are all on-board for a 2018 reunion.\n\n'As it stands, they will be working together on a series of projects, which will include an album and a TV special celebrating the Spice Girls - and getting Victoria to agree has been a coup for everyone involved, given she has always been the person holding back on a reunion.'\n\nBut alas, Spice Girls fans, we need to stay rational about this.\n\nPut away the platform trainers and ask yourself, 'would Victoria actually agree to this?'\n\nLet us present an analysis...\n\nAlthough many a source is reporting that Scary, Baby, Sporty, Ginger and Posh are set to make a comeback next year, we mustn't forget the numerous times that Beckham has staunchly opposed a Spice reunion.\n\nIt was only earlier this year that ex-Posh Spice turned fashion mogul told U.S. breakfast show The Today Show that 'there won't be a reunion because I think that when we performed at the Olympics, it was so great, and that was us celebrating everything that we'd achieved'.\n\nShe then went on to say: 'I still talk to all the other girls, we're still very close, but I think you need to know when it's time to actually say, \"That was great, we achieved a lot,\" and everybody moves on.'\n\nA new album doesn't sound much like moving on, does it?\n\nUnderstandably, Victoria now has a family and a thriving business in the fashion industry to look after and, in the past, has cited these commitments as her reasoning for not wanting to reunite with her bandmates.\n\nAll hope is not lost, however, as, when asked about a potential Spice Girls reunion, Mel C was previously quoted on The Nightly Show saying: 'I kind of feel like it's not really doing the band justice to go out as a four piece, whoever's missing it doesn't matter.'\n\nSo, surely if there were to be some kind of reunion it must involve all five original members... right?\n\nDare we believe the rumours that all five have been in 'secret talks' over the summer and are on board? Should we really raise our hopes that high?\n\nWhatever the case, the Spice Girls will always 'Viva Forever' in our hearts.\n",

    "text": "Jim Carrey Attends Fashion Week Party Just to Roast Fashion Week Parties\n2017-09-11\nJim Carrey, once an actor, now an artiste, and cultural commenter, stopped by New York Fashion Week to neg it. E! News\u2019s Catt Sadler caught up with Carrey on the red carpet of the Harper\u2019s Bazaar Icons party Friday night, and the two-minute clip of their exchange has been percolating on Twitter ever since. After she pointed out that she\u2019d never seen him at the biannual spectacle, he explained to her the following: \u201cThere\u2019s no meaning to any of this. So I wanted to find the most meaningless thing that I could come to and join and here I am.\u201d Watch Sadler\u2019s eyes as she fully comprehends what she\u2019s about to endure.\n\n\u201cCelebrating icons,\u201d Carrey says. \u201cBoy, that is just the absolute lowest aiming possibility we could come up with. Do you believe in icons?\u201d\n\nWhen Sadler started to answer, he interjected, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in personalities. I don\u2019t believe that you exist, but there is a wonderful fragrance in the air.\u201d\n\nCarrey then looked in the camera and gave his speech, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in icons. I don\u2019t believe in personalities. I believe that peace lies beyond personalities, beyond invention and disguise, beyond the red \u2018S\u2019 that you wear on your chest, that makes bullets bounce off. I believe that it\u2019s deeper than that. I believe we\u2019re a field of energy dancing for itself, and\u2014uh\u2014I don\u2019t care.\u201d (It wasn\u2019t exactly extemporaneous poetry; the lines are borrowed from a commencement speech he gave in 2014 at Iowa\u2019s Maharishi University of Management).\n\nYes, he sounded like a liberal-arts student on a particularly mellow week night. And it\u2019s not clear whether he sensed the irony in himself saying all of that while attending the party and wearing a flashy tailored suit (Asked about his get-up, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t get dressed up. There is no me. There\u2019s just things happening.\u201d).\n\nCarrey\u2019s referendum, despite its slightly unbearable pitch, rings somewhat true amid the backdrop of destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. And Charlottesville. And the general mood of melancholy that has settled over the country like a thick fog. It\u2019s hard to see where the art and commercialism and spectacle of N.Y.F.W. fits into all that. Designers themselves have struggled with that question since the 2016 election, as have many creators in other fields. The world looks different now than it did even last February, and it will somersault a thousand more times before the clothing parade gears again up next February. (But, make no mistake, the parade will go on.)\n\nBut that\u2019s not even it, really, Carrey said. \u201cIt\u2019s not our world. We don\u2019t matter. That\u2019s the good news.\u201d Great!\n",

    "text": "\nOne might not normally expect to find Leonardo DiCaprio , Patti Smith , Alex Rodriguez, and Jennifer Lopez at the same party (well, the last two, perhaps), but this weekend, all four were among the estimated 4,500 attendees of an auction preview at Christie\u2019s. There, they had the chance to get eyes on \u201cSalvator Mundi,\u201d a Leonardo da Vinci painting previously thought lost that is being touted as \u201c The Last da Vinci \u201d leading up to its auction tonight.\n\n\u201cThe Last da Vinci,\u201d which dates to 1500 and is estimated to sell for around $100 million, is also the title of the new Christie\u2019s video promoting the piece\u2019s auction, an event that's getting the marketing treatment of a summer blockbuster movie. Supposedly shot from the perspective of Jesus (that is, from the perspective of the painting, which depicts Jesus as \u201cSavior of the World\u201d), it depicts various viewers gathered in front of the painting, many of them glassy-eyed with emotion. And, Where\u2019s Waldo -like, a keen-eyed observer might also spot Smith and DiCaprio, fresh off his 43rd birthday, among the video\u2019s subjects, albeit looking significantly less on the verge of tears than many of the other viewers.\n\nAfter all, DiCaprio might just be there to get a few insights, Daniel Day-Lewis-style, into his next character: The Oscar-winner and climate justice enthusiast is slated to play Leonardo da Vinci in an upcoming biopic based on Leonardo da Vinci , the biography by Walter Isaacson. Paramount scooped up the rights to the film back in August, with DiCaprio slated to star in, and co-produce, the film, which will require him to grow his Revenant beard to unprecedented lengths.\n\nBringing things full circle, \u201cThe Last da Vinci\u201d is scored by the Max Richter piece \u201cOn the Nature of Daylight,\u201d a movie-soundtrack staple that was recently used in the opening scene of Arrival and, before that, in Shutter Island , which, yes, starred DiCaprio, and was directed by Martin Scorsese, from whom DiCaprio is now practically inseparable . It\u2019s probably only a matter of time before Scorsese signs on to DiCaprio\u2019s da Vinci biopic. After all, they\u2019re also working on a Teddy Roosevelt biopic together. But Leo, while you're playing namesakes, where is that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot?\n\nMargot Robbie, who co-starred with DiCaprio in 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' is here to show you what vegemite sounds like:\n",

    "text": "\nPossible new \"Twilight\" film can see Kristen Stewart reprising her role as Bella Swan, with a new report claiming that she did not drop movie plans with former beau, Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen). Some reports say that Stewart said no to her reunion project with Pattinson as she is busy with the psychological thriller, \"Underwater.\" \"Twilight\" fans however can keep their peace as the actress did not reject playing Bella once more.\n\nReportedly, Stewart has not dropped the possibility for another film with Pattinson because there has been no official plan for the film yet. According to Gossip Cop, the actress' casting in her upcoming film does not directly affect the saga should it be revived.\n\nOn the contrary, it seems the actress hints interest for another \"Twilight\" film. She previously told Press Association (via Metro) that she will be among the first to read the continuation of the saga as soon as Stephanie Meyer publishes it.\n\n\"I would definitely be the first to read it, yeah,\" she said. There is no official confirmation from Meyer yet if she will be releasing a new book anytime soon. But it looks like it is the only thing that producers are waiting for to start pre-production of a new movie.\n\nMeanwhile, the actress has opened up about herself with the Sunday Times. \"I didn't talk about my first relationships that went public because I wanted things that are mine to be mine,\" she said. A previous Elle interview shares why she doesn't tend to share much about her personal life. \nBut eventually, Stewart realised that she had several eyes on her and that talking about her personal life can benefit someone else. \"It was an opportunity to surrender a bit of what was mine, to make even one other person feels good about themselves,\" she added.\n\nShe was in a relationship with Pattinson but the couple broke up in 2013. Last year, the actress came out as a lesbian. She was in a relationship with visual effects producer, Alicia Cargile.\n\nThe final \"Twilight\" film was released in 2012. Since then, the actress has appeared in a series of films such as Olivier Assayas' \"The Clouds of Sils Maria,\" for which she won the Cesar Award for Best Supporting Actress. Stewart has also played Jodie Foster's daughter in the thriller \"Panic Room,\" in which she got a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Leading Actress in a Feature Film.\n",

Taylor Swift will not be attending the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday, August 28, multiple sources confirm to Us Weekly.\n\nThe country starlet turned pop phenom - who won four Moonmen at last year's ceremony, including Video of the Year for her celeb-packed \"Bad Blood\" visual - was not nominated for any Moonmen this year, though her clips for \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Out of the Woods\" (off her blockbuster 1989 album) were both eligible.\n\n\n\nWhile neither video is up for an award, the award show is still technically honoring Swift, 26, if you consider her contributions to ex-beau Calvin Harris' Rihanna-assisted hit \"This Is What You Came For,\" which is nominated for Best Collaboration. The \"Shake It Off\" hitmaker secretly sang on the track and wrote it under the pseudonym Nils Sjoberg.\n\n\n\nDespite her lack of nominations, the Grammy winner never planned on attending this year's show. Though fans will undoubtedly miss Swift's presence on Sunday night, the highly anticipated event is shaping up to be one of MTV's most epic yet.\n\n\n\nAs Us Weekly previously reported on Thursday, August 25, artists such as Kanye West, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna have big plans in store.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWest, 39 - who was presented with the prestigious Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award by his sometime enemy \u00a0Swift at the 2015 VMAs - will most likely perform \"Famous,\" the controversial song in which he takes credit for the \"Blank Space\" songstress' fame. The video for the NSFW tune - featuring nude lookalikes of Swift, West, Kim Kardashian and others sleeping in bed - is nominated in several categories, including the coveted Video of the Year award.\n\nIn addition to Yeezy's performance, multiple sources confirm to Us that Queen Bey, 34, will light up the VMAs stage as well. And just when music fans thought it couldn't get any better: RiRi, who will receive the Video Vanguard Award this year, is set to sing \"several songs throughout the show,\" a source tells Us.\n\n\n\nConfirmed performers for the show include Rihanna,\u00a0Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj and Future.

Is Gwen\u2019s hearing going to be okay?\n\n\nGwen Stefani, 47, went through a terrifying ordeal on April 25 when her eardrum ruptured while on a flight. The painful injury landed Gwen in Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where doctors told her not to fly anywhere or sing until it gets healed. The brutal injury came at exactly the wrong time for Gwen. She was supposed to sing at the Power f Love gala in Las Vegas just two days later.\n\nThe pop star/The Voice judge had to bow out of the prestigious event at the MGM Grand where she was set to perform a 30-minute live set, because of her limitations. That\u2019s so awful! Guests at the event, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, were told about the cancellation right before the event. Gwen recorded a short apology video that was played for the guests and gala honorees: \u201cI am so sorry that I cannot attend tonight, But I wanted to send a message of congratulations to Andre Agassi and my dear friend Ronald Pearlman,\u201d Gwen said.\n\n\nBlake Shelton & Gwen Stefani Hunt For Eggs With Her Kids During Easter Celebration -- See Adorable Pics\n \nThe event hosted by the Keep Memory Alive charity to help find cures for memory and movement disorders, honored the tennis legend with the Community Leadership Award, and honored Ronald for his \u201coutstanding philanthropy.\u201d While attendees were bummed that they couldn\u2019t see Gwen\u2019s set, they got an incredible replacement: Jennifer Hudson!

She was still on The Voice this week and looked happy! A ruptured eardrum is no small deal, though. It occurs when a small perforation pops in the eardrum, sometimes from trauma, ear infection, loud noises, surgery, or flying in a plane with a severe cold. You know how your ears pop in a plane? It\u2019s like that, but way worse. It can lead to temporary hearing loss, or ringing in the ears.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how severe Gwen\u2019s eardrum is injured, but the healing process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, and in some very rare cases, years.\n\nHollywoodLifers, we hope Gwen feels better!

    "text": "\nDespite earning four nominations for his album Purpose, Justin Bieber had no plans to attend the Grammy awards this year. Rather than sitting at home alone, however, he decided to go out for sushi, and took fans along for the ride on his Instagram Story. (Other bystanders captured a few snaps of him walking into the restaurant as well for a full 360-degree look at what it's like to have dinner with Justin.)\n\nOf course, this move is a statement, and not a subtle one at that. TMZ reportedly spoke to a source that said Justin \"doesn't think the Grammys are relevant or representative, especially when it comes to young singers.\"\n\nRegardless, choosing not to show up to an award show for which you have received multiple nominations, and then to highlight that fact by doing something so overtly casual is pretty suspect.\n\nHowever, this wasn't the only questionable act that went down on Justin's Instagram Live feed this weeknd. He also posted a video in which you hear someone ask him, \"Favorite song at the moment?\" He pauses, and then replies: \"'Starboy,' by The Weeknd,\" before bursting out into laughter, making it clear that the comment was sarcastic. You then hear the second voice in the video say: \"We've gotta end it now. That was too funny.\"\n\nBut we beg to differ, especially as it's not the first time Justin's taken a swipe at his fellow artist - and it's that consistency that is concerning. This past January, he called The Weeknd's music \"whack,\" so we already knew he wasn't exactly a fan. It's a significant comment mostly because it appears to be a bitter snide from an ex. As we all know, Selena Gomez has been spotted with The Weeknd, and though their relationship hasn't been officially confirmed, there's enough evidence \u2013\u00a0Justin's response included \u2013\u00a0to speculate that the two are an item.\n\nDissing a fellow artist for no reason-\u00a0and especially when the question posed was open-ended and positive - isn't cool. Doing it to your ex's new partner is as petty as petty gets. If nothing else, it's shown us that Justin has more #feelings about the situation than we realized.\n",

    "text": "\nA source close to Taylor Swift has reportedly denied suggestions that the singer is set to launch her own streaming service.\n\nSwift's uneasy relationship with streaming services is well noted. In 2014, she pulled her music from Spotify, arguing that \"the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace\". She later allowed Apple Music to exclusively stream her '1989' album after they changed their royalty policy following a critical open letter she posted.\n\nTMZ\u00a0recently reported that Swift filed documents to trademark a 'Swifties', what they described as a streaming service \"featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings\".\n\nHowever, a source from Swift's camp has since told\u00a0Billboard\u00a0that the singer \"would not be launching a streaming service\". Instead, the report suggests that Swifties would be more \"like a personalized fan club app complete with exclusive merchandise, audio/video/live performances and the possibility of a mobile game of some sort\".\n\nMeanwhile, Ed Sheeran appears to have let slip the release date of Taylor Swift's new album. There had previously been rumours that Swift would release a new album in October 2016. However, no album surfaced last autumn. The singer-songwriter had previously released each of her five albums every two years in either October or November, with her last record '1989' released in October 2014.\n\nIt was also reported last\u00a0year that Taylor Swift had recruited Drake to help her make an album of \"edgier R&B and hip-hop sounds\". \u00a0Swift is also rumoured to be\u00a0working on new music with Kesha.\n",

Other members of the royal family can just do more.\"\n\nIn recent years, she\u00a0has reduced the number of public engagements she attends but\u00a0continues to carry out her functions on state matters.\n\nShe\u00a0no longer makes long haul overseas trips\u00a0and other members of the royal family have been undertaking foreign tours and official state visits in her name.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Kate, for example caught the world's attention during the Diamond Jubilee Tour on behalf of the Queen in September 2012.\n\nThere have\u00a0also been discussions about the possibility of the crown \"leapfrogging\" Prince Charles in favour of his son Prince William.\n\nBut this has been dismissed since it would cause\u00a0a constitutional crisis, with Prince William previously saying there was \"no question\" of it happening.\n\nSpeaking in 2012 about his future on the throne, Prince Charles, 68,\u00a0said: \"Impatient? Me? What a thing to suggest! Yes of course I am. I'll run out of time soon. I shall have snuffled it if I'm not careful\".\n\nKeen to engage in public life, Prince Charles has depicted himself as a champion of environmental issues.\n",

Bieber had 14 shows left, including several in the U.S. and Asia. A photographer caught the Biebs yesterday in L.A., and he explained he just needed a break after 16 months of touring. \"Yeah, everything's fine, yeah\" he told the man on camera. \"I've been on tour for two years. It is [a long stretch,] yeah. Yes, [I'm looking forward] to resting, getting some relaxation, I'm going to ride some bikes.\"\n\nHe offered this message to his fans: \"I love you guys, I think you guys are awesome. Sorry for anybody who feels like disappointed or betrayed, that's not in my heart or anything. And uh, have a blessed day!\" Then he gave a peace sign.\n\nHis manager Scott Braun also posted an Instagram, explaining Bieber ended the tour for his own well being. \"On behalf of myself, Justin, and the team, we are sorry,\" he wrote to the hurt fans. \"That was never our intent. But a man's soul and well being I truly care about came first and We must all respect and honor that. Justin will be back and I know he looks forward to performing for you and with you all again. One chapter ends and another begins. Thank you again. \"\n\nBut! Australia's Today Show had an interesting report of another reason Bieber ended the tour early. Apparently the Biebs, who famously attends Hillsong Church, has a \"Son of God\" tattoo across his chest, and was recently at Hillsong Conference with his friend Pastor Carl Lentz, wants to start his own church. An inside source told a reporter that the reason \"he came off the road is because he wants to reconnect with his faith, and he may be even planning to start his own church. We know that he was in the country [Australia] a few weeks ago having meetings and attending the big Hillsong convention that they had here. Very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he's looking at teaming up with them or something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own, starting his own church, we're not quite sure.\"\n",

    "text": "\nNot too long ago Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid were just two young, unconnected girls who occasionally appeared on their family members' reality television show. Then the world blinked and all the sudden they were burgeoning supermodels and super influencers. Then the world blinked again and they were bonafide supermodel BFFs. Another blink and their sisters, Kylie and Bella, were also burgeoning influence and burgeoning models in their own right.\n\nOne more blink and they're now four of the most famous young women on the entire planet and they all hang out with each other in various groupings and form the core of one of the most powerful girl squads in the entire world.\n\nOf this we all know, and, yet, what we did not know is how any of them actually came to actually know each other and became friends in the first place.\n\nThere were simple guesses: Kendall and Gigi just met on the fashion circuit and took a liking to one another.\n\nThere were more complicated guesses based on the fact that the two pairs of sisters are sort of \"related\" in the way that all European royal families are sort of related\u2014through a complicated string of marriages and divorces. The story: before Kris Jenner, the Jenners' father Caitlyn\u2014n\u00e9e Bruce\u2014used to be married to a woman named Linda, and after their divorce Linda married the composer David Foster. Linda and David also got divorced, and then the Hadids' mother Yolanda married David after her first marriage to the sisters' biological father Mohamed. Naturally, Yolanda and David are now divorced as well.\n\nSo, maybe some assumed they just met at a very awkward extended family reunion, of sorts.\n\nAs it happens, that is not the case.\n\nEarlier this year came a stunning new clue in the mystery. While everyone thought that it was Kendall and Gigi who were the original nexus of the friendship web, it turned out that Kendall was actually friends with Bella first.\n\nNow, finally, after far too long spent thinking about this, we have a definitive answer and it is way, way more mundane and even a bit geekier than we ever imagined.\n\n\"I met her for the first time seven years ago over Twitter,\" Bella told InStyle . \u201cThat was before we started modeling; I was probably 14 or 15. We met up and had sushi, and now we\u2019re best friends. She\u2019s a pretty significant human I met online.\u201d\n\nWhile there is still shame in this world about admitting you've met anyone online, the fact that two of the most popular girls in the world did so back when they were \"14 or 15\" should satisfy everyone, and, once and for all, any questions about how the Jenners met the Hadids.\n",

For manner of death, a box was marked for \"accident.\"\n\nThe report didn't specify how the drug was taken and if the fentanyl was prescribed or illegally made.\n\nThe music superstar weighed 112 pounds and was 63 inches tall when he died, the report said. He was wearing a black cap, shirt, pants, boxer briefs and socks and a gray undershirt, the report said. His occupation was listed as \"artist\" and his business as \"music.\"\n\nThe full autopsy and toxicology reports will not be released, the office told CNN.\n\nSince his death, information has emerged about the entertainer's alleged abuse of prescription drugs.\n\nA law enforcement source told CNN's Evan Perez in April that the entertainer was found with opioid medication at the time of his death. Investigators so far haven't found any indication that Prince had a valid prescription for the recovered opioid medications\n\nAn attorney for Prince's half-siblings said they revealed the singer had an addiction to Percocet decades before he died. One half-sibling said Prince started using the drug to help him deal with the rigors of performing, not for recreational use.\n\nOn April 15, on his way home after performing in Atlanta, Prince's plane made an emergency landing in Moline, Illinois. Prince was unresponsive and taken to a hospital. A law enforcement official told CNN he was treated for a potential overdose of pain medication.\n\nThe day before Prince died, his team called an eminent opioid addiction specialist in California seeking urgent help for the singer, an attorney working for the specialist and his son said.\n\nThe specialist, Dr. Howard Kornfeld, couldn't get there immediately so he sent his son, Andrew Kornfeld, on an overnight flight to Minnesota. The goal was for the younger Kornfeld to help evaluate Prince's health and encourage him to enter treatment for pain management and potential addiction issues, attorney William Mauzy told reporters.\n\nBut by the time Andrew Kornfeld arrived at the singer's Paisley Park complex on the morning of April 21, it was too late. He and two Prince representatives found the 57-year-old entertainer unresponsive in an elevator. Andrew Kornfeld was the person who called 911, Mauzy said.\n\nAuthorities have also said the investigation into Prince's death is a criminal investigation. It was not immediately clear if Kornfeld is the subject of a separate investigation.\n\nFederal prosecutors and the Drug Enforcement Administration are investigating how Prince obtained prescription medications and from whom, the agencies said.\n",

He seems in a real hurry to move in with Meghan,\" a source told the Mail Online.\n\nHarry currently lives in Nottingham Cottage, a two-bedroom house on the Kensington estate, but it seems he's in the market for an upscale. According to the reports, the apartment (which here doesn't mean 'a small house in an apartment block', but rather 'an entire wing of Kensington Palace, similar to Kate and Wills' 22-room house') is located next to Harry's brother and sister-in-law, meaning Meghan will also inherit some tiny neighbours in the form of Prince George and Princess Charlotte.\n\nMeghan, 35, and Harry, 32, seems to be moving relatively quickly after getting together mid-last year. The two have already attending weddings together (something Kate and Wills didn't do until after they were engaged), met each other's families (and when your family includes the Queen of England, that's a relatively big deal) and told friends an engagement is on the way.\n\nMaybe Meghan will be able to attend Pippa Middleton's 'no bling, no bring' wedding after all.\n\n",

The quote does not appear in the online version of the magazine, but BuzzFeed reports\u00a0that it did appear in an advance version sent to certain outlets, including\u00a0to BuzzFeed UK.\n\nThe reported quote read: \u201cAt first I thought, \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019m so Hillary [Clinton],\u2019 but I had a long political call with Caitlyn [Jenner] last night about why she\u2019s voting Trump. I\u2019m on the fence.\u201d\n\nHeadlines declared \u201cKim Kardashian Is Suddenly (And Disappointingly) Considering Voting For Donald Trump,\u201d \u201cCaitlyn Jenner Convinces Kim Kardashian to Consider Trump\u201d and \u201cHillary Clinton Supporter Kim Kardashian Might Vote for Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAnd, according to\u00a0Kardashian, her phone blew up with messages from family, friends and both candidates\u2019 camps. So she took to her website Saturday night and explained why she was \u201c\u2018on the fence\u2019 about my vote,\u201d she wrote.\n\n[Master of horror fiction Stephen King says \u2018Trump presidency scares me to death\u2019]\n\n\u201cThere was a point when I wasn\u2019t 100% sure I was even going to vote in this election; I didn\u2019t want to vote blindly,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I also thought about how not voting would mean that I wasn\u2019t making my voice heard, so I decided to talk to my closest friends and family who I love and trust, to have an open conversation about politics.\u201d\n\nShe\u00a0spoke with Jenner, who encouraged her\u00a0\u201cto do my research before making my decision and then vote for the candidate whose policies aligned with the things that matter most to me.\u201d For Kardashian, that included \u201cgun control and protecting women\u2019s rights to safe and legal abortion.\u201d\n\nKardashian continued: \u201cI found that without a doubt, I stand with Hillary. I\u2019m with her. I believe Hillary will best represent our country and is the most qualified for the job. This year, I\u2019m not just voting for myself, but also for my children, and I took that into careful consideration when I made my decision.\u201d\n\nShe also wrote that she believed both Clinton and Trump \u201chave the intention of making the country a safer and stronger place for every American.\u201d\n\nJenner, for her part, has made varying statements about Trump and Clinton. In a March episode of her show, \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d she said she was not a Trump fan because of \u201chis macho attitude\u201d but would \u201cnever ever ever vote for Hillary. We\u2019re done,\u00a0if Hillary becomes president. The country is over.\u201d\n\nBut in August, Jenner told\u00a0HBO\u2019s Bill Simmons, \u201cI honestly have not outwardly supported anybody.\u201d\n\nKim Kardashian: \u2018I want my children to grow up knowing that their lives matter.\u2019\n\n\n",

Biden\u2019s older son, who died of brain cancer in 2015.\n\nThe former president said some kind words about Beau and his parents, Joe and Jill Biden, before talking about the joys and sorrows of watching children grow up.\n\n\u201cFor those of us who have daughters, it just happens fast,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a video published by WDEL, a news outlet based in Wilmington, Del.\n\n\u201cI dropped off Malia at college, and I was saying to Joe and Jill that it was a little bit like open-heart surgery, and I was proud that I did not cry in front of her.

    "text": "\nThere\u2019s something missing. Can you feel it? A slight twinge in the universe, quick and subtle, but a definite sign that something in the world just shifted. Ah, here\u2019s what it is\u2014Kanye West just deleted his Twitter and Instagram accounts.\n\nThe rapper apparently decided to abolish his social-media presence on Friday, waving good-bye to all those followers and likes and faves. Those tweets about Wiz Khalifa\u2019s cool pants? Gone. That \u201c###hashtag all positive vibes\u201d tweet? Gone. Those \u201cI\u2019M SO LUCKY\u201d tweets accompanied by nearly nude shots of his wife, Kim Kardashian West? Banished to the nothingness hinterlands of deleted posts. So too are all those random Insta photos of old Margiela lookbooks. For what it\u2019s worth, West was never much of an Instagram power user anyway, deferring to his wife on that social platform (though he occasionally made strong post recommendations). His Twitter account, however, was practically an extended part of his brain, a home for stream-of-consciousness thoughts that caused as much controversy as they did delight. So why did he delete it? And what does it all mean right now?\n\nWell, this isn\u2019t the first time West has waved good-bye to his social-media platforms. Sometimes, it\u2019s because the artist wants to garner a little bit of buzz for upcoming projects. Back in 2013, West deleted all of his tweets, leaving only one cryptic message up: \u201cJune Eighteen.\u201d That ended up being the release date for his upcoming album Yeezus, which was famously inspired by a Corbusier lamp and was released without an album cover or promotional singles.\n\nSo what could it be this time around? West ended 2016 on a rough personal note, hospitalized for exhaustion and sleep deprivation. He later kicked up controversy by meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower shortly after his election, tweeting about it, and then deleting those tweets. West, as all his fans know, has serious political aspirations, announcing his presidential dreams at, of all West-ian locations, the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nNevertheless, West has been maintaining a low profile as of late and is probably putting his political dreams on the back burner for the moment. It\u2019s more likely that he\u2019s deleting his social accounts (1) to get attention, and/or (2) for an upcoming artistic project. The workaholic is constantly working on new music and new fashion for his Yeezy Season line and Adidas collection. On Friday, he and Kardashian West launched TheKidsSupply, a high-priced children\u2019s clothing collection. He recently released a high-end collection of religious-inspired gold jewelry. \u201cI wanted to create something that represented timeless love,\u201d he recently told Vogue.\n\nThe only thing missing from his endless release cycle is . . . new music. Last year, shortly after releasing The Life of Pablo (a release cycle marked by controversial tweets), __West tweeted about a cryptic new music project titled Turbo Grafx 16, after the old gaming console. However, that project seems to have fallen to the wayside, as there have been new rumblings of a NASA-inspired project, though it was later debunked by fans. Still, it\u2019s impossible to believe he\u2019s not working on something new.\n\nBut maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014West is . . . merely enjoying being an incredibly rich celebrity? Taking a much-needed break from the public eye? The fashion-obsessed star recently skipped the Met Gala, an event he\u2019s frequented numerous times over the year as the chief ambassador of #vibes and shredded jeans. Why did he skip it? He just wanted to stay home, according to his wife.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been taking some time off and really loving that,\u201d she told Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley on the red carpet.\n\nO.K., we\u2019ll consider that story . . . for now. But don\u2019t expect West to stay off social media for too long.\n",

At her new L.A. mansion, Jolie reveals the tension between the two Angelinas and the reason her life will never be normal.\n\nLike most things involving Angelina Jolie, stepping foot into her house is an experience so heightened one wonders if it\u2019s for real or the product of careful orchestration. The large gates to her recently purchased Los Feliz house\u2014an 11,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts mansion once owned by the epic filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille\u2014slowly swing open, revealing rolling lawns, lush trees at the perimeter. No one\u2019s there, and all is quiet except for the delicate sound of fountains, arched in a row over a swimming pool. A number of doors to the house are open, as if posing some riddle from a fairy tale\u2014which one to enter? Inside, the vibe is airy and calm: all open windows and cross-breezes, creamy-white unlit candles, soft creamy-white furnishings. Finally she emerges from the other side of the house and glides across the room in a creamy-white, floor-length caftan. Her hair is down, her feet bare, only a touch of makeup, her skin luminous. She smiles widely\u2014a beneficent, ethereal wood nymph. But as soon as she starts speaking, you realize that your preconceived notions about Jolie aren\u2019t quite right. She\u2019s not a celestial goddess. She\u2019s not the high-and-mighty do-gooder. She\u2019s not the intense control freak\u2014or at least not obviously so. She comes across, rather, as normal-person friendly and practical, even chitchatty. She explains the deal with the big empty mansion. She moved into this space just four days ago with her six kids. It wasn\u2019t for the prestigious history or the architecture. She needed a good place fast, somewhere secluded, with a lot of rooms; this one, which was listed for around $25 million, has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms. Following her September 2016 filing for divorce from Brad Pitt, she and her children spent nine months in a rental, basically living out of suitcases. And so she hasn\u2019t really unpacked, barely knows her way around the place, has never had a real visitor, and isn\u2019t sure where the best spot is to sit and talk. With that in question, she roams from room to room\u2014the fabulous kitchen, worthy of a Nancy Meyers movie, charming gray library with a library ladder (her favorite room in the house), the generous landing at the foot of a sweeping staircase, anchored by a round table with a bouquet of white flowers. She finally settles on the living room, which a set-decorator friend furnished on the fly, with two creamy-white sofas and some big throw pillows. She looks at them curiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I needed \u2018throw pillows.\u2019\u2009\u201d Decorating, house stuff, \u201cthat was always Brad\u2019s thing.\u201d On cue, as if taunting her, Jolie\u2019s large Rottweiler, Dusty, soaking from a trip to the pool, jumps onto the sofa, soiling it. She sighs, amused, half tries to wipe it off with her bare hand, then gives up and sits somewhere else. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Life in her household is apparently like this\u2014messy, relaxed, normal. The kids are polite but not phony polite. Zahara, 12, whom Jolie describes as \u201cthe rock\u201d of the family, comes downstairs. \u201cZaz!\u201d Jolie cries, midsentence. They discuss the whereabouts of everyone else. Zahara hugs the wet dog. Jolie laughs and tells her daughter about the swim Dusty just took. We move to the kitchen, where Jolie fixes herself a cup of tea. Vivienne, 9, comes in with a friend, having just been at a sleepover. She\u2019s wearing a jean backpack covered with pins. Jolie envelops her in her arms. I ask the girl if she\u2019s called \u201cViv\u201d or \u201cVivienne.\u201d \u201cEither one!\u201d she says with a smile. She dumps her stuff on the counter and goes out to play with her friend. Jolie picks up a small piece of a blanket, shredded to death, and explains, laughing, \u201cShe has 32 blankets. She is very into her blanket, and she gets very mad if you wash her blanket. She actually said to me the other day, \u2018Mom, I can taste my blanket.\u2019 \u2018That, honey, is a sign that it really, really needs to be washed.\u2019\u2009\u201d Jolie tidies up Vivienne\u2019s things and promptly spills her entire mug of tea all over the counter. We step outside and there\u2019s Shiloh, 11, and Knox, 9, hanging out. Shiloh, who likes to dress like a boy, is wearing a camouflage jacket, long shorts, and heavy black sneakers, despite the blazing heat. Knox immediately wants to know when Jolie\u2019s going to put up the waterslide. \u201cHow about a \u2018Hello, Mom\u2019?\u201d she says, with a hug, sounding like just about every other loving, exasperated mother in America. So far, there\u2019s only one piece of personal artwork up\u2014a black-and-white photograph on the mantelpiece of the six children, smiling and holding their various pets\u2014dogs, reptiles, and rodents.\n\nJolie and Pitt, who\u2019d been together for 12 years and appeared to be the most gloriously evolved couple in Hollywood, split last September. She filed for divorce suddenly \u201cfor the health of the family,\u201d according to her lawyer, and announced she was seeking sole custody of the children, three of whom are adopted (Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, and Zahara), three of whom are biological (Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox). Things had been rocky for some time, but the last straw was a dramatic trip on a private plane, where there was reportedly a physical and verbal altercation between Pitt and Maddox. When they touched down, Jolie went home with the kids, effectively kicking him out. This was no \u201cConscious Uncoupling.\u201d An anonymous phone call was made to authorities. The F.B.I. and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services began investigating Pitt for child abuse. He was soon cleared and later said in an interview with GQ Style that he was smarting from the pain of his suddenly broken family and admitted he had a serious drinking problem. There were rumors he was having an affair with Marion Cotillard (denied by both Pitt and Cotillard). Jolie got the early jump P.R.-wise. But Pitt won hearts and minds with the mea culpa in GQ Style. The two are still negotiating the terms of their divorce. As for Jolie, a life already bursting at the seams\u2014with acting, directing, humanitarian work, parenting six kids, and guest-lecturing on women\u2019s rights at the London School of Economics\u2014just got exponentially bigger and more complicated, because she\u2019s now doing it alone. There\u2019s the chaos surrounding the practical day-to-day\u2014playdates, doctors\u2019 appointments, packing and unpacking, and organizing mealtimes. And there\u2019s the deeper, emotional chaos. \u201cIt\u2019s just been the hardest time, and we\u2019re just kind of coming up for air. [This house] is a big jump forward for us, and we\u2019re all trying to do our best to heal our family.\u201d As it happens, the personal trauma has coincided with her most personal film yet. Jolie has directed a moving, large-scale adaptation of First They Killed My Father, Loung Ung\u2019s 2000 memoir of the Khmer Rouge genocide, in which Ung\u2019s parents and two of her siblings perished, along with an estimated two million other Cambodians, a quarter of the country\u2019s population. Shot entirely in Cambodia, and in the Khmer language, the film, a Netflix original, is the largest production the country has witnessed since the war, and according to the reports of several Cambodians who\u2019ve seen it, it\u2019s one of the most revelatory pieces of art about that chapter in the country\u2019s history, a history that\u2019s still difficult for Cambodians to discuss. But if Cambodians consider the film to be something of a gift, then it\u2019s surely a thank-you gift. For Jolie, Cambodia is where she started her family, and it\u2019s where she made a cathartic personal transformation, becoming the woman she is today.\n\nRecall, if you can, the Angelina of the late 90s, the era of Angie Peak Crazy. Specializing in dark volatile characters that seemed extensions of her wild-child restless self, Jolie won three Golden Globes for her roles in television movies and a best- supporting-actress Oscar for her portrayal of a young woman with apparent borderline personality disorder in Girl, Interrupted. She talked freely about having dabbled in heroin and self-cutting, and her love of knives. She and new husband Billy Bob Thornton wore each other\u2019s dried blood in pendants around their necks, and publicly bragged about their wild sex. At the 2000 Oscar ceremony, she talked provocatively about being \u201cso in love . . . right now\u201d with her brother, James, and kissed him with unsettling intimacy. To be sure, Jolie had legitimate pain in her early life\u2014her father, actor Jon Voight, had been unfaithful to her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, and the two split up early on. But it was First World pain. Being Hollywood\u2019s newest \u201cIt girl\u201d landed Jolie the title role in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, based on a popular video game. As it happened, the movie, an example of Hollywood\u2019s most vacuous, commercial, shoot-\u2019em-up instincts, was filmed on location in Cambodia. There, Jolie, who\u2019d grown up in privileged bubbles in Los Angeles and New York, witnessed what real suffering looked like: poverty, the loss of limbs from land mines, a generation of relatives wiped out. In this world there was no room for free-floating malaise or self-indulgent antics. And in spite of their profound trials, \u201cI found a people who were so kind and warm and open, and, yes, very complex,\u201d recalls Jolie. \u201cYou drive around here you can see a lot of people with many things, but not often expressing happiness. You go there, and you see the families come out with their blanket and their picnic to watch a sunset.\u201d Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. She suddenly became curious about the world\u2014starting with the country she was in. One day in Siem Reap, Cambodia, she picked up a book that was being sold on the side of the road for $2: Ung\u2019s memoir. It was among the factors that inspired Jolie to find a greater purpose. In 2001, equipping herself with as much knowledge as she could, she contacted the United Nations and eventually became a goodwill ambassador for the High Commissioner for Refugees. On one of her first U.N. missions, in 2002, she returned to Cambodia to meet up with NGO workers who were dealing with land-mine issues. Among them was Ung, the author of that transformative book, who had moved to America since the war but had spent her adult years working on Cambodia\u2019s troubles. She had never seen an Angelina Jolie movie, but Jolie certainly didn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s vision of a movie star. \u201cShe was just a really cool human being,\u201d recalls Ung. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t mind getting dirty.\u201d On her relationship with Brad Pitt: \u201cWe care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.\u201d She and Jolie clicked and made a plan to travel together to a land-mine-filled part of Cambodia where Ung hadn\u2019t been since the war. Thus began a sequence that sounds as though it must have been written for a movie\u2014but it wasn\u2019t. They met up with a bunch of de-miners, took off on mo-peds, with only a flashlight and some extra toilet paper as supplies, when a monsoon started. Soaked, they went to bed in hammocks. Before going to sleep, Jolie realized she already trusted Ung enough to ask her about something personal, something big she\u2019d been thinking about\u2014adopting a Cambodian orphan. \u201cI asked her as a Cambodian orphan if she would be offended for somebody like me, an outsider, [to do that], or if that would be a nice thing,\u201d recalls Jolie. Ung was wholeheartedly supportive. \u201cAngie was maternal to everybody around her, not just children, but adults included. I wanted her to adopt me,\u201d says Ung. \u201cI was orphaned when I was eight years old, and so I think, when you\u2019ve gone through experiences like that, there\u2019s always a part of you that craves to have full parent figures in your life.\u201d Jolie says that Ung\u2019s enthusiasm for the idea of her adopting was a deciding factor. Had she responded differently, explains Jolie, \u201cit might have changed my decision. It might have made it very hard for me.\u201d Ung has been in Jolie\u2019s life ever since and is now one of her few close friends. Jolie immediately set the adoption process in motion. A couple of months later, she visited an orphanage in the provincial town of Battambang, having promised herself that she\u2019d go only to one, that she wasn\u2019t going to shop around. But Jolie felt uneasy as she wandered the rooms, meeting the children. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a connection with any of them,\u201d she recalls. Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. \u201cThey then said, \u2018There\u2019s one more baby.\u2019\u2009\u201d Baby Maddox was lying in a box that was suspended from the ceiling. She looked at him. He looked at her. \u201cI cried and cried,\u201d she recalls.\n\nAnd thus began a 15-year project, in which Jolie rebranded herself, expanding her world, her family, her career, and her image. She bought a house in Cambodia and became a citizen. In 2003, she started what became the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation, focusing on Cambodia\u2019s environmental conservation, health, education, and infrastructure. She intensified her U.N. work, going on dozens of fact-finding missions, to such global hot spots as Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, and Haiti. (She\u2019s now been on more than 60 missions.) She split from Thornton, who didn\u2019t understand her newfound passion. She adopted her second child, Zahara, from Ethiopia. In 2004 she met Pitt, on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, when he was still married to Jennifer Aniston. For Jolie, dating Pitt\u2014Hollywood\u2019s gorgeous, laid-back golden boy\u2014catapulted her to another level of fame. Though she has maintained that they didn\u2019t become romantically involved until he and Aniston had split, the couple wasted no time in exhibiting their romance for the pages of W, which did a 32-page spread of them playing house, with a pretend brood of five. Aniston was devastated. For Pitt, dating Jolie meant doing it her way, at least at the outset. It marked the beginning of his own philanthropic life\u2014in Africa, Haiti, and New Orleans\u2014and he formally adopted Maddox and Zahara. He persuaded Jolie to have biological children. She gave birth to Shiloh in 2006, in Namibia, then the twins, Vivienne and Knox, in 2008. In between they adopted Pax, then three, from Vietnam. They bought more homes\u2014in France, Spain, New York, and New Orleans. While Pitt, as a producer and actor, churned out one prestige movie after another (Moonlight, The Tree of Life, Moneyball, 12 Years a Slave), Jolie took a new chance with directing\u2014with In the Land of Blood and Honey, about Bosnia, a project inspired by some of the U.N. work she\u2019d done there. Together, they appeared unstoppable, the most creatively alive citizens on the planet. Nothing seemed beyond their abilities. They traipsed around the globe as a nomadic clan of eight, making art, doing good, and setting up home wherever they happened to be. They tied the knot in 2014, mainly because the kids wanted them to. They had the means to take along tutors for the children wherever they went. But Jolie\u2019s idea of an education meant immersion in the real world, to bring an understanding of one\u2019s \u201csmall part in the bigger picture.\u201d For a time, it all worked beautifully. Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.\n\nIt was 2012, and Jolie had recently finished In the Land of Blood and Honey. She wanted her next project to be just as meaningful, and Ung\u2019s story had at this point been with her for a decade. By the time they had a completed draft, the chance for Jolie to direct Unbroken, based on the best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand, had come along, and they put the script aside. After that, Maddox, who knew \u201cAuntie\u201d Loung\u2019s story, brought it up. \u201cHe was the one who said, \u2018It\u2019s time to do it,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Jolie. She knew that Maddox would be deeply involved in the production, that he\u2019d be \u201cstanding there watching horrors that his countrymen did to each other. [So] he had to be ready.\u201d Jolie and Ung dived back in. Credited on the film as an executive producer, Maddox read draft after draft, giving comments. Jolie took it to Netflix, where chief creative officer Ted Sarandos signed on without hesitation. \u201cIn the room, she created a visual experience of what this film could be,\u201d recalls Sarandos. \u201cThe film is in many ways about the death of beauty, about the way the Khmer Rouge had killed all things beautiful, color itself, which becomes part of the joy of life. . . . That\u2019s what hooked me more than anything.\u201d Despite Jolie\u2019s Cambodian ties, she felt she needed a Cambodian filmmaker to help shepherd the project. So she reached out to Rithy Panh, one of the most famous filmmakers in Cambodia, who had lost family members to the genocide and had chronicled the Khmer Rouge in several documentaries, including The Missing Picture, which was nominated for the best-foreign-language-film Academy Award in 2014. She and Panh agreed that the only way this film could be made was if Cambodia wanted it to be\u2014not a foregone conclusion, given that Cambodians are still somewhat reticent about their painful history. (The Killing Fields, Roland Joff\u00e9\u2019s 1984 film about the Khmer Rouge, had to be filmed in Thailand and elsewhere.) The war tribunals, which were set in motion in 2009 and are ongoing, have helped open up the topic. Still, Jolie was trepidatious and approached the country\u2019s culture ministers gingerly, explaining that they were telling not just Ung\u2019s story but also the story of a people. Jolie\u2019s Cambodian track record made the difference, says Ung. \u201cIn a country like Cambodia, respect is very much elevated\u2014respect for each other, respect for the culture, respect for the history, respect for the elders. Angie walks in Cambodia with this respect.\u201d Cambodia went all in\u2014closing off Battambang for days, giving the filmmakers permits to land in remote zones, providing them with 500 officials from their actual army to play the Khmer Rouge army. \u201cIt\u2019s not a poetic thing to say\u2014[this film] was made by the country,\u201d says Jolie. Between cast and crew, some 3,500 Cambodians participated.\n\nTo cast the children in the film, Jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship. In order to find their lead, to play young Loung Ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. The director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. \u201cSrey Moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,\u201d Jolie says. \u201cWhen she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. All these different things came flooding back.\u201d Jolie then tears up. \u201cWhen she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn\u2019t have enough money for a nice funeral.\u201d That authentic connection to pain was awakened in everyone involved, says Jolie, making for a film set like nothing she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a person who was working on the movie who didn\u2019t have a personal connection. They weren\u2019t coming to do a job. They were walking in the exodus for the people whom they had lost in their family, and it was out of respect for them that they were going to re-create it . . . It completed something for them.\u201d Some had flashbacks and nightmares. For this reason, a therapist was on set every day. And then there were the odd bystanders who hadn\u2019t been aware that a movie was being made, and were traumatized. In one scene, recalls Jolie, \u201cwhen the Khmer Rouge came over the bridge, we had a few people who really dropped to their knees and wailed. They were horrified to see them come back.\u201d Given the size and complexity of the production, a different Hollywood director might have, consciously or not, muscled in and flexed her power in a way that might have seemed boorish. According to Ung and Panh, Jolie knows Cambodia so well she\u2019s internalized the country\u2019s character traits. At lunch, she waited in line like everyone else, recalls Panh, and she never raised her voice. \u201cHere we don\u2019t shout. We talk,\u201d he says. In Cambodia, yelling is not just disrespectful\u2014it\u2019s also considered a sign of weakness. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Many eyes were on Maddox, who is as famous in Cambodia as Jolie. \u201cIt was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked,\u201d says Jolie, who wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d ultimately react to the experience. Would he connect? Would he want to flee? Jolie was thrilled one morning during the shoot when she heard Maddox say, \u201cCan I go sleep in my house with my friends?,\u201d referring to their house in the jungle, which she had bought back in 2002. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard him refer to it that way. You can\u2019t push it. You can\u2019t say, \u2018Isn\u2019t this great?\u2019 You just have to kind of keep bringing them there, putting it in front of them . . . and hope that they find the pride and find the comfort.\u201d She considers the endeavor to connect Maddox to his homeland\u2014as she does Zahara to Ethiopia and Pax to Vietnam\u2014a family effort, not a solo one. With that in mind, while Pitt was in the Middle East working on War Machine, the other five kids also went to Cambodia and played a role, official or not, in their mother\u2019s movie. Pax did still photography. The other four were on set every day and became close playmates with the child actors. In February, the film premiered for an audience of 1,000 at the outdoor amphitheater near the temple complex of Angkor Wat. According to numerous reports, it was a screening filled with tears of recognition, remembrance, and catharsis. What moved Jolie perhaps more than anything was that \u201cthe Cambodian people had a big movie premiere. They saw a movie for which they made the sets. [It was] their actors doing a great job, their country looking beautiful even through all the horrors.\u201d\n\nAlas, while she was making film history for a country, her relationship with Pitt was suffering. By the time First They Killed My Father was in postproduction, in the summer of 2016, \u201cthings got bad,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to use that word. . . . Things became \u2018difficult.\u2019\u2009\u201d There has been Hollywood talk that their lifestyle had taken its toll on Pitt, and that he was craving a more stable, normal life for the whole family. When I bring this question up to her, it\u2019s the one moment when Jolie becomes a bit defensive. \u201c[Our lifestyle] was not in any way a negative,\u201d she says quickly, adamantly. \u201cThat was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children . . . They\u2019re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I\u2019m very proud of them.\u201d Jolie has indicated that, for the sake of the kids, she doesn\u2019t want to talk about the breakup. And yet it seems she wants to get her point across, which calls for a careful choice of words, something of a high-wire act. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very brave. They were very brave.\u201d \u201cIn times they needed to be.\u201d Other statements are similarly cryptic. \u201cWe\u2019re all just healing from the events that led to the filing . . . They\u2019re not healing from divorce. They\u2019re healing from some . . . from life, from things in life.\u201d I mention Pitt\u2019s mea culpa in GQ Style. Did it surprise her? \u201cNo,\u201d she replies, looking unmoved. I refer to tabloid reports that suggest their communication has improved, and ask if that\u2019s true. There\u2019s a long pause. She looks down, formulates an answer. \u201cWe care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.\u201d There\u2019s anger and pain right there beneath the surface. But she\u2019s trying to keep the emotions at bay. \u201cI was very worried about my mother, growing up\u2014a lot. I do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it\u2019s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything\u2019s going to be all right even when you\u2019re not sure it is.\u201d Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Her protectiveness over the kids has become all that more fierce due to her recent brushes with the specter of ovarian cancer; the disease took her mother\u2019s life when she was just 56, as well as those of other family members. In a 2013 New York Times op-ed column, Jolie chronicled her decision to have a preventive double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after she learned she had the BRCA1 gene. Two years later, while working in the editing room on By the Sea, she got a call from the doctor saying that he was concerned about certain levels in her blood work that potentially suggested cancer. \u201cTen minutes later, the room\u2019s spinning, and you just think, How . . . ?\u201d She kept the news from the kids, did further tests, and waited a few agonizing days. When she finally learned she didn\u2019t have cancer, \u201cI dropped to my knees.\u201d She made an appointment to get her ovaries taken out. \u201cI went into the actual surgery happy as they come. I was skipping. Because at that point it was just preventative.\u201d She instantly went into menopause. Last year, in addition to hypertension, Jolie developed Bell\u2019s palsy, a result of damage to facial nerves, causing one side of her face to droop. \u201cSometimes women in families put themselves last,\u201d she says, \u201cuntil it manifests itself in their own health.\u201d Jolie credits acupuncture for her full recovery from the condition. Lately, her skin has become drier, she reports, and she has extra gray hairs. She quips, \u201cI can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s menopause or if it\u2019s just been the year I\u2019ve had.\u201d The idea that she could still be anyone\u2019s idea of a sex symbol is laughable to her. But she says, \u201cI actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I\u2019m being smart about my choices, and I\u2019m putting my family first, and I\u2019m in charge of my life and my health. I think that\u2019s what makes a woman complete.\u201d Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.\n\nTomorrow, Jolie and the kids are headed to Africa. They\u2019re visiting Namibia, where Shiloh was born, and Kenya, where Jolie will be checking in with a project connected to the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative, an organization she co-founded with British former foreign secretary William Hague. Specifically, members of the British military and peacekeepers will be receiving training in how to protect women from sexual violence in crisis zones. It\u2019s not the obvious dream itinerary for a kid, and Jolie admits that she\u2019s started to get a little pushback with the older ones. \u201cI\u2019m conscious that the boys are teenage boys, and maybe they\u2019d rather be watching TV with their friends, and they\u2019ve been to Africa, and they may not be as excited as the little ones. But they don\u2019t really challenge me. They just kind of sit on the edge of my bed and say, \u2018What are we going to do there?\u2019\u2009\u201d She assured them that she\u2019d planned fun activities for them, like sandboarding. In any case, \u201cthey know that it\u2019s important, and they know that Mom thinks that it\u2019s going to be important when they\u2019re older.\u201d She knows it sounds a little strange, but Jolie can\u2019t help who she is. \u201cI never woke up and thought, I really want to live a bold life. I just can\u2019t do the other. It\u2019s the same as I can\u2019t make a casserole. I cannot sit still.\u201d For all her earlier talk about being interested in keeping house, now, as the conversation turns to Africa, she\u2019s champing at the bit, desperate to flee. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying for nine months to be really good at just being a homemaker and picking up dog poop and cleaning dishes and reading bedtime stories. And I\u2019m getting better at all three. But now I need to get my boots on and go hang, take a trip.\u201d She believes that her personal will is infectious. The other day she made some joke to Knox along the lines of \u201cPretend to be normal.\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018Who wants to be normal? We\u2019re not normal. Let\u2019s never be normal.\u2019 Thank you\u2014yes! We\u2019re not normal. Let\u2019s embrace being not normal!\u201d Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.

You get time to grow up. I think if you're growing up attached to another person, you never really get solid as your own being,\" she explained. \"So I'm really solid, and then he gets to be really solid, and then together, we get to be two really grounded people.

But fans of Justin Bieber's ex-girlfriend should not rejoice over the reports because they were declared as all lies.\n\nAccording to Gossip Cop,\u00a0the above-mentioned reports were found out to be all false and the source of the news was merely fabricating stories. The site which is out to expose hearsays and false reports about celebrities has verified the said reports.\n\nThe news that was published by Hollywood Life\u00a0dated March 23 states that the \"Mother's Day\" star was excited for her little sister's new beau and she was grateful that she has found peace in life. She was reportedly proud of her and of what she has become. They were already talking about the planned double date as alleged by the report. Gomez was reportedly spending time with her boyfriend's family.\n\nIn another report from the same source dated January 17, 2017, it states that the \"Horrible Bosses\" actor has told the \"Kill Em With Kindness\" singer to follow her heart and that the Justin Theroux's wife was giving love advices to Selena Gomez.\n\nWell, with the reports on Aniston's reactions about her friend's love life being debunked, the only reliable source would be people close to Gomez and since they have not publicized anything, it is best to take everything with a grain of salt. Regarding the double date, the probability that it will happen is nil at the moment but who knows, it might happen in the future.\n\nThe Weeknd and the 24-year-old former Disney star's relationship became controversial after it was revealed months back. The rapper has just moved on from a relationship with Bella Hadid and the model even warned her ex-boyfriend about Gomez.

The hip-hop heavyweight is hitting the road in support of \u201c4:44,\u201d his 13th solo studio album.\n\nThe tour is being produced by Live Nation Entertainment, which has sustained a lengthy and lucrative multifaceted relationship with Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter.\n\nTickets for the New Orleans show range in price from $29.50 to $125 plus fees and service charges. They go on sale to the general public Friday, July 14, which follows presales for subscribers to Jay-Z's music streaming service, Tidal, and Citi card members. Those presales commenced at 11 a.m. on Monday.\n\nFor this tour, Jay-Z will use an in-the-round configuration, where the stage will be at the middle of the arena floor, with seating on all sides.\n\nThe rapper/music industry mogul\u2019s personal life has frequently brought him to New Orleans in recent years. In February, he visited the Smoothie King Center to watch the 2017 NBA Allstar Game with his wife, Beyonc\u00e9, and the couple\u2019s oldest daughter, Blue Ivy. He has also accompanied Beyonc\u00e9 on numerous trips to the Crescent City to visit her sister, Solange Knowles.\n\nBut he has also graced New Orleans stages on a fairly regular basis.

At least if you've got some money on hand and are feeling generous.\n\nTwenty years after their tragic onscreen love story ended, the Titanic costars are reuniting for a good cause: At this year's Auction Gala, hosted by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, one lucky bidder will have the chance to have a private dinner with Jack and Rose\u2014erm, Leo and Kate\u2014at the NYC restaurant of their choosing sometime in October or November, People reports .\n\nThe star-studded event is set to take place in St. Tropez on July 26, and proceeds from the dinner and auction will go to support environmental causes via the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. According to People , last year's gala raised $45 million, and the Foundation has reportedly donated over $80 million in environmental grants since its conception in 2008. Proceeds from the dinner with DiCaprio and Winslet, specifically, will also be put toward the Golden Hat Foundation, which benefits children with autism and their families, and a GoFundMe campaign that Winslet is involved with that's attempting to raise money to help a young mother in the U.K. afford cancer treatment.\n\nIn addition to getting the chance to bid on dinner with the greatest doomed onscreen couple of our time, gala guests will be treated to a special performance by Lenny Kravitz. According to a statement from the Gala, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo will also be in attendance to receive the \"New World Leadership Award\" in honor of her \u201cinnovative approach to making Paris a model for sustainable urban living and design,\u201d People adds.\n\nIf last year's guest roster was any indication, the invite list rivals the likes of the Met Gala and the Academy Awards. Past attendees have included Bono, Chris Rock, Mariah Carey, Tobey Maguire, Jonah Hill, Naomi Campbell, Bradley Cooper, and Edward Norton. And according to E!, this year's list of chairpeople for the event includes Madonna, Cate Blanchett, Emma Stone, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hanks, Jared Leto, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, and Kate Hudson, among others.\n\nFor anyone who didn't make the invite list (or doesn't have hundreds of thousands of dollars to shell out on a single dinner) but still wants the chance to sit next to DiCaprio, try your luck at flights from Los Angeles to St. Tropez: Word on the street is that he's flying commercial to the event.\n",

    "text": "\nUncomfortable seating aside, it sounded as though Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's secret wedding, this summer, went off without a hitch. Incredibly, details about the Malibu nuptials were not leaked to press. Jimmy Kimmel did a \"beautiful\" job ordaining the ceremony, finding the perfect balance between sweet and funny. Howard Stern gave a speech. And afterward, the newlyweds embarked on the fanciest group honeymoon of which we've ever heard. But on Wednesday, while promoting the new season of HBO's The Leftovers, Theroux revealed that the duo did make one \"massive miscalculation\" when planning the wedding.\n\nTheroux explained that, to keep the wedding below-the-radar, he and Aniston told different guests different reasons why they were throwing a party at their house this past August. Initially, they told most guests it was a birthday celebration for Theroux. But when certain people R.S.V.P.'d no because of busy schedules, the couple felt the need to spill the secret to entice them to be there on the special day. Of course, that meant that the in-the-know guests were dressed like they were attending a wedding, while the rest were in jeans and flip flops, so that each guest could easily tell who had been trusted with the secret and who hadn't.\n\n\"It was actually a massive miscalculation,\" Theroux said of their wedding plan. \"Afterwards, we kind of realized, like, that was a terrible plan, because you're basically telling half your guests, 'You're unemployed and we can't trust you,' which was of course not the case, but we just kind of put it out there, and people that said yes to the birthday [we didn't tell], and then people who said, 'We can't,' we really put more pressure on them to be at the 'birthday.'\"\n\nAnd then, of course, there were also the friends who, during Theroux and Aniston's engagement, just got into the habit of dressing in formal wear each time they were invited to the couple's home in the off-chance that the get-together would turn out to be the couple's much-anticipated wedding.\n\n\"We also have friends who, when we've done barbecues and stuff, show up, like, dressed to the nines, like, 'This is the thing, right?,'\" Theroux said. \"And we're like, 'No, this is actually just a barbecue.'\"\n\nOn a happier note, though, Theroux said he is relishing the fact that he is finally able to call Aniston his wife. \"The first couple days of doing it-it's a great feeling.\"\n",

    "text": "\nLeft, by Mike Pont/WireImage; Right, from GC Images, both from Getty Images.\n\nIn 2010, famously private Jake Gyllenhaal and Taylor Swift dated. Nearly a decade later, he's shutting down questions about it in interviews-this time in The Guardian.\n\nAt the time, Gyllenhaal was nine years her senior-a minor scandal-but the relationship only lasted three months. It would have turned into one of the smoldering ember piles of forgotten celebrity relationships that dot the tabloid landscape if not for that maple-latte photo and \"Red,\" the song Swift allegedly wrote about Gyllenhaal, which initiated him into a sort of club: a group of men that have inspired Swift songs.\n\nNow, nearly seven years later, in the year of our Lord 2017, the actor has to contend with the unhappy reality of answering questions about his time with Swift. Call it club dues, made payable to interviewers.\n\nGyllenhaal has spoken about the relationship without giving too much away before (notably in 2015 on Howard Stern), but he's no longer abiding those questions. Writer Tim Jonze for the The Guardian found that out in an interview, which was ostensibly about the actor's new movie, Life. Here's the tensest part of the exchange, as it's rendered by Jonze:\n\nFor someone so intensely private, wasn't it playing with fire a little to start dating [Taylor Swift]? Asking this proves to be a mistake. \"I think when you're in a relationship, you are constantly scrutinised, your friends are scrutinised, but ...\" He trails off and stares at me, ramping up the intensity of his eyes like he's done in so many roles. But what? Gyllenhaal just continues to stare. Then he performs an exaggerated shrug. So, er, did he listen to any of the many songs rumored to be about him? More silence. The atmosphere has become uncomfortably tense. Would he like to move on? \"I would love to not talk about my personal life.\" I don't think this is, massively. \"Oh, really? You don't?\" he asks.\n\nAre you s-h-i-v-e-r-i-n-g yet? Put on another layer because later Gyllenhaal recounts his time meeting Obama and manages to bring it back to The Question. \"[Obama] told me: 'You have a job as an artist to help people through difficult times, to illuminate things through art.' He said: 'That's your job.' And my parents have always said that, too. And I'm sure you know it, because you seem like a very smart person who has done their research, particularly into tabloid research, which is obviously the most important of all research.\"\n\nAnd that's not it for the Siberian tundra of an actor. Still on politics, Gyllenhaal says, \"So, it's an irony to me when people say: 'An entertainer or actor should not be political,' because it's very easy to sideline people and, for instance, ask about past relationships or things that I believe are meant to be private.\"\n\nGyllenhaal is the iceberg, and Jonze, the Titanic, completely sunk by Gyllenhaal's final act: \"muttering\" to a handler, \"It's always the last [interview of the day].\" We've all learned a valuable lesson, too. Gyllenhaal's Life is fair game, but his life is not.\n\nVanity Fair has reached out to Gyllenhaal for comment.\n",

    "text": "\nThe place is known as the Miraval Ch\u00e2teau, a castle and vineyard in the tiny\u00a0town of Correns, near Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt bought it in 2008 for \u20ac45 million (about $67 million at the time), and it hosted\u00a0their wedding six years later.\n\nAfter three years of legal battle, the decision was originally delivered in April but wasn't revealed until French media broke the story last week. Meanwhile, the aggrieved designer, Odile Soudant, has filed another suit demanding to be\u00a0legally recognized as the creator of the project.\n\nThe artist, who specializes in light installations, accused the Jolie-Pitt company of driving her\u00a0business, Lumi\u00e8res Studio, into bankruptcy. She's also fighting Pitt for the intellectual property rights to\u00a0the lighting she designed for the 17th century chateau and its outbuildings. Of the payout,\u00a0\u20ac60,000 ($70,800) covers\u00a0damage to her reputation, which she says has been severely affected by\u00a0the failed project.\n\nPitt's lawyers had argued that the project was late and over budget\u2014and that the design was Pitt's brainchild.\n\n\u201cWhen, in 2010, Brad Pitt came to ask her to bring to light four buildings of his domain at\u00a0Miraval, the plastic artist Odile Soudant did not suspect that this Pharaonic building site was going to cause her ruin,\u201d writes Le Point.\n\nThe Hollywood couple, according to the newspaper Liberation, which broke the story, launched a large remodeling plan intended to\u00a0transform the property to their liking. Pitt hired Soudart in 2010 to run\u00a0a \u20ac25 million project that would\u00a0bring natural light into four of the buildings of the 40-bedroom domain where, in the late 1970s, the band Pink Floyd had recorded an album.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, he wanted\u00a0the visual artist to create \"an exceptional place with light at the center of everything.\"\n\nThe collaboration went smoothly for three years until Pitt discovered that the company acting as the general contractor managing the network\u00a0of businesses involved in the remodeling was inflating the costs. He then blocked all additional payments.\n\nUntil then, the artist and her 17 assistants and subcontractors had been working for the project in a Paris studio and partially completed the redesign at the property. Despite the fact that Pitt was no longer paying, according to her declaration, he asked her to continue\u00a0working.\n\n\u201cOdile, I need you. Come here please. I need you to finish,\u201d Brad\u00a0Pitt\u00a0wrote in an email to Soudart, according the court documents published\u00a0by Liberation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don\u2019t attack friends,\"\u00a0he wrote her in another email. \"I\u2019ve been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let\u2019s finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend,\u201d he wrote to her in another.\n\nIn a third message,\u00a0he wrote: \u201cDon\u2019t waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don\u2019t worry about the rest.\u201d\n\nHer answers were\u00a0desperate: \"My company and my bank accounts are well beyond the maximum. I can no longer use my credit card. I'm sinking. I do not ask you to pay everything, but at least a part...I do not know how to make you understand the urgency in which we are now. Without a quick solution, the consequences will be catastrophic.\u201d\n\nBut the legal struggle has not yet ended. Soudart is now accusing Pitt of appropriating the creation\u00a0of her work. The actor\u2019s lawyers replied that the castle is \"purely private\" and not subject to copyright.\n\nBut Le Point concludes that\u00a0\u201cthe estate is not as private as its owners claim: Recently it served as a backdrop for the latest Guerlain ad campaign by Terrence Malick. In one of the scenes, we see clearly\u2014no pun intended\u2014a luminous installation conceived by the plastic artist.\u201d\n\nThe one minute clip\u00a0\u00a0called \"Notes of a Woman\"\u00a0shows Angelina Jolie \u00a0strolling through different spaces at Chateau Miraval, practicing her lines and wandering through the vineyard as a man creates a perfum.\n",

We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters.\"\n\nBeyonce didn't give any further details of when the babies will arrive, but their arrival will come five years after the couple welcomed their first child, daughter Blue Ivy, in January 2012.\n\nThe happy news comes nine years after the couple tied the knot in a private wedding ceremony in April 2008.\n\nThe star later revealed she had miscarried a child around 2010, describing it as the \"saddest thing\" she had ever been through.\n\nThankfully they were blessed with daughter Blue Ivy in 2012, but in the last couple of years, the pair had been dogged by rumours they were intended to divorce, not expand their family.\n\nHowever the latest announcement finally shuts down the speculation once and for all, with the family now looking forward to their new arrivals.\n\n",

She addressed them at the end of her hour on Sept. 29, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been very exciting, it\u2019s been so educational, I\u2019ve been just so delighted by the media response, which is really\u201d \u2014 she shook her head before continuing \u2014 \u201cno.\u201d\n\nAfter a breath, she added, \u201cThe viewer response has been awesome!\u201d\n\nAs Ms. Kelly moved away from the sometimes prosecutorial persona she inhabited during much of her tenure at Fox, there were a few bumpy moments. The \u201cWill & Grace\u201d star Debra Messing said after appearing on the show that she regretted having done so. Jane Fonda blanched when Ms. Kelly asked her to talk about plastic surgery procedures she has had. And a vulgarity uttered by a cameraman who inadvertently walked into a shot went viral.\n\nAnother awkward moment came on Oct. 3, two days after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, when Ms. Kelly cut off Tom Brokaw, the former longtime NBC anchor and network eminence, as he went into a lengthy discourse on gun rights and the National Rifle Association.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Ms. Kelly said, adding that she had to \u201cleave it at that, Tom,\u201d before shifting to a commercial break. (Mr. Brokaw later told The Washington Post that he was having problems with his hearing aid. \u201cI\u2019m a Kelly fan,\u201d he added.)\n\nMs. Kelly has said that the show would be a mix of a talk show and a news show, and it has moved in both directions, from typical morning fare \u2014 celebrity interviews, a segment involving an adorable crime-fighting dog \u2014 to gritty discussions of the O. J. Simpson and Menendez brothers cases.\n\nNBC has said from the start that it would be patient with the show. Andrew Lack, the network\u2019s news chairman, told affiliates months ago that he did not expect things to be \u201cperfect\u201d with both of Ms. Kelly\u2019s new programs \u2014 she also hosts a Sunday evening show, which is on hiatus \u2014 in the early going.\n\nAt least for now, it appears that Ms. Kelly\u2019s main competitor, ABC\u2019s \u201cLive with Kelly and Ryan,\u201d will maintain a lead in the ratings. In the top 56 media markets, \u201cLive\u201d beat \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d by 21 percent in households last week, according to Nielsen.\n\nExact audience figures for last week\u2019s episodes of \u201cLive,\u201d a syndicated show featuring Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, will not be available until next week. It averaged an 2.8 million viewers in the week before Ms. Kelly\u2019s debut, with 915,000 in the 25-to-54 age range.\n\nFor Ms. Kelly and NBC executives, there was one hopeful nugget buried in the Nielsen data: The number of viewers in the 25-to-54 demographic was 755,000 on Sept. 29, after having fallen to roughly 649,000 the day before.\n",

During his first post-presidency trip to his native Hawaii this week, Obama played a few rounds of golf at the Mid Pacific Country Club and took in a meal\u00a0at Buzz's Steakhouse in Kailua - all with minimal security.\n\nObama wore a white polo and blue shorts for his golf outing, as well as his new favorite accessory: a\u00a0big grin.\n",

I'm so unbelievably ecstatic that his family chose to honor me and that the AMAs chose to honor me with this.\"\n\nShe even took the opportunity to speak out on her anti-streaming stance (sorry, Spotify), saying, \"And lastly, you, you guys! To the fans who went out and bought over a million copies of my last three albums, what you did by going out and investing in music and albums, you are saying that you believe in the same thing that I believe in-that music is valuable, and that music should be consumed in albums, and that albums should be consumed as art and appreciated, and I love you so much.\"\n\n\"I love getting to know you,\" she said, addressing her fans. \"I love talking to you online. I love having a glimpse into your life and I'm so unbelievably happy that you want to have a glimpse into my life. Thank you so much.\"\n\nClass act!\n\n",

Beyonc\u00e9, who\u2019s pregnant and expecting twins with husband Jay Z, took to Instagram on Memorial Day, Monday, May 29, to show off her baby bump in an adorable photo featuring their 5-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.\n\nIn the pic, the pop superstar \u2014 dressed in a blue bikini and matching sheer cover-up \u2014 blows a kiss to her little girl who she\u2019s holding. For her part, Blue rocks a printed one-piece, a straw hat and, yes, even a few golden flash tats.

Except Nicole Kidman, that is.\n\nThe actress' seldom-moving face has been the subject of speculation the past few years, inspiring headlines like \"Help! I Can't Move My Face!\" Fortunately, Nicole's decided to address the rumors head on. And even though we've seen a bit of flip-flopping, her latest stance is that her visage is \"completely natural.\"\n\n\"No surgery for me,\" Nicole tells Italy's La Repubblica. \"I did try Botox, unfortunately, but I got out of it and now I can finally move my face again.\"\n\nWe don't know how recently this skin epiphany went into effect, but it's safe to say that her face stayed suspiciously still at the Golden Globes this month -- nary a frown line or a crow's foot. Also, back in May 2011, the 45-year-old maintained that she had \"nothing\" in her face, so was she glossing over the whole Botox thing?\n\nThis time around, she deemed the non-surgical treatment an \"unfortunate move\" and that she's moved on to more effective age-defying tricks. \"I wear sunscreen, I don't smoke and I take care of myself, and I am proud to say that,\" Nicole said.\n\nSunscreen as the fountain of youth?

    "text": "\nAs rumours that Sarah Jessica Parker will succeed Anna Wintour at US Vogue are shot down, we ask: Who could step into Wintour's Manolo Blahniks when the time comes?\n\nIt's possibly the most ludicrous fashion rumour we've ever heard but claims that Anna Wintour has been grooming Sarah Jessica Parker as her replacement at US Vogue got us thinking: who will replace her when she eventually leaves?\n\nWintour's will be some metaphorically big shoes to fill, she is American Vogue. Here we place our bets...\n\nVictoria Beckham: the chameleon \n\n She's come a long way since her days as a Zig-a-zig-ah-ing Spice Girl and now sits firmly at the top of the international fashion tree. Who's to say she can't morph into a magazine editor next?\n\nAnna Dello Russo: the exchange programme \n\n Can you imagine Vogue in the hands of the woman that brought us 'Fashion Shower'. Wouldn't it be amazing? A stalwart fashion editor, Dello Russo certainly has the vision, even if it is a bit, umm, outrageous.\n\nAmy Astley: the safe choice \n\n The editor-in-chief of Vogue's little-sister publication Teen Vogue, Amy Astley has worked with Wintour before when she was a beauty editor at Vogue. Well respected in fashion circles, Astley would be a very safe pair of hands to leave big Vogue in.\n\nNatalie Massenet: the business guru \n\n The founder of Net-A-Porter, Natalie Massanet is an omnipotent presence in British fashion as the chair of the BFC. However, she's US-born, used to be a fashion editor at Tatler and she's got Wintour's seal of approval. \"Natalie's doing a very good job,\" said the editor-in-chief of Massenet's impact on London Fashion Week. \"She's a very organised person and she's obviously having an impact on where the shows are located.\"\n\nEva Chen: the proteg\u00e9e \n\n When Wintour became artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast she immediately bumped former beauty editor Eva Chen up to editor of Lucky, one of Conde Nast's US titles. Chen is very well known, and liked, in the industry meaning the top title at Vogue may well be hers one day.\n\nMarc Jacobs: the curveball \n\n Think about it. \"He's opinionated and has some spare time now [that he's left Louis Vuitton],\" says Lisa Armstrong, \"also a brilliant stylist in addition to knowing what we all want to wear.\"\n\nTamara Mellon: the all-rounder \n\n The Jimmy Choo co-founder has business savvy and a creative mind. Since setting up her eponymous label (in NYC, no less) she knows how to stand up to a boardroom of investors and get ideas off the ground. Plus she's glamorous, supremely well-connected and used to work at British Vogue.\n\nTonne Goodman: the internal hire \n\n Surrounded by British-born counterparts at US Vogue, Goodman, the magazine's fashion director is like a fresh breath of Manhattan air. Styling tricky celebrities is her bread and butter, and no-one understands the demands of the high-earning American woman better than she.\n\nRoger Federer: the sporty spice \n\n OK, this suggestion is as likely as Andy Murray winning Wimbledon (oh... hang on) but the tennis supremo attends shows with Anna, while she cheers him on from the stands. He certainly knows how to wear a suit, and has probably learnt more than meets the eye from those fashion soirees the two love to hang out at.\n\nJohn Galliano: the provocateur \n\n A curveball perhaps but it's well known that Anna is a huge supporter of Galliano's. It was her that got him his first post-scandal job at Oscar de la Renta and what better way to bring him back to the top than to seat him in her big, shiny editor's office?\n\nLena Dunham: the voice of a generation \n\n Dunham is US Vogue's current flavour of the month, quite literally, as she appears on the February cover - the result of months of wooing by Wintour, apparently. Often dubbed 'the voice of her generation', she would certainly bring a new voice.\n\nLucy Yeomans: the Brit pick \n\n Yeomans was appointed editor of Harper's Bazaar in the UK when she was just 29 years of age. Now masterminding the launch of Net-A-Porter.com's first print magazine, Porter, fashion journalism runs through her veins.\n\nMeryl Streep: when life imitates art \n\n As The Telegraph's fashion editor Lisa Armstrong comments: \"If we're choosing editors based on the fact they once played writers, what about someone who actually played an er, editor - Meryl Streep?\" A valid point we're sure you'll agree.\n\nStefano Tonchi: the editor's choice \n\n Italian-born Tonchi would be a publisher's dream; he's the current editor of style bible W (also owned by Conde Nast) and has previously worked at Esquire, L'Uomo Vogue and edited T: The New York Times Style Magazine. He moves in similar circles to Wintour and would be editorially-focused.\n",

(Jump to the 54-minute mark in the video.) He apologized to the attendees for having to \"crash this party,\" before letting his wife know what she means to him.\n\n\"Now, the idea that you would even put up with me for a quarter of a century is a remarkable testament to what a saintly, wonderful, patient person you are,'' he said. \"It was a lot easier for me to do it because the fact of the matter is that not only have you been an extraordinary partner, not only have you been a great friend, somebody who could always make me laugh, somebody who would always make sure that I was following what I thought was right, but you have also been an example to our daughters and to the entire country.\"\n\nHis sentiments came after Michelle had posted a photo from their 1992 wedding on Instagram with a message of love for the former president on their anniversary.\n\n\"Your strength, your grace, your determination, your honesty, the fact that you look so good doing all this, the way in which you've always taken responsibility for your own actions but also for looking out for the people around you is remarkable,'' he continued. \"And it's no wonder that as people got to know you the way that I got to know you, they fell in love.\"\n\nHis message was the latest example of the type of genuine affection between the two that was often on display in many touching moments throughout the eight years they were in the White House.\n\nBarack and Michelle have been together since 1989, when he met her while working as a summer associate at a Chicago law firm where she worked.\n\n\"It is truly the best decision that I ever made to be persistent enough, asking you out on a date, that you finally gave in,'' he said. \"And I hope you feel the same way.

For starters, the rapper didn\u2019t even attend the tennis star\u2019s nuptials. Gossip Cop can set the record straight. Williams got married to internet entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian in front of friends and family in New Orleans on Thursday. The guest list included many celebrities, including Beyonce, Kim Kardashian, Kelly Rowland, Anna Wintour, Ciara and Eva Longoria. Minaj wasn\u2019t in attendance, but the Irish website Her posted a doctored Instagram photo that shows her posing at the party with Beyonce and Rihanna. The site titled its inaccurate article, \u201cWhat Nicki Minaj wore to Serena Williams\u2019 wedding is not really OK,\u201d and says the singer showed up to the ceremony sporting \u201cwhite leather hotpants and a crop top.\u201d The misinformed outlet insists Minaj\u2019s outfit was \u201ckinda too much,\u201d further maintaining that she \u201cvery much overstepped a wedding etiquette line.\u201d But the site\u2019s opinion about the rapper\u2019s attire is completely moot. Neither Minaj or Rihanna were at the tennis player\u2019s wedding. Both music stars were superimposed into a photo of Beyonce posing alone at the ceremony. It\u2019s unclear if the Irish outlet is trying to trick its readers or get duped by the fake image itself, but Minaj didn\u2019t wear an inappropriate outfit to Williams\u2019 wedding, which she didn\u2019t attend. It should be noted, Gossip Cop has had to debunk several false stories surrounding the tennis star\u2019s nuptials in the short time since she walked down the aisle. We recently busted HollywoodLife for fabricating a report about Beyonce and Kardashian having an \u201cicy exchange\u201d at the wedding.

    "text": "\nEmbattled comedian Kathy Griffin says she's not afraid of Donald Trump and plans to keep making fun of him but maintained that she's sorry for a video that depicted her holding a likeness of the president's severed, bloody head.\n\nAt a rambling press conference Friday, Griffin tearfully predicted her career is over and said Trump \"broke me.\" Since the video was posted Tuesday, she has lost her job co-hosting CNN's New Year's Eve special and had all her upcoming comedy shows cancelled. Trump, first lady Melania Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have publicly criticized the video.\n\nGriffin, who asserted that she has been contacted by the Secret Service, said the Trumps are \"trying to ruin my life forever.\"\n\n\"The president, the first lady and the Secret Service have all made very clear their view on those thoughts,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.\n\nGriffin, 56, repeated her claim that the video was a parody, meant as a pointed comeback to Trump's remark last summer that former Fox News Channel personality Megyn Kelly had \"blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of wherever.\"\n\n\"I'm not laying down for this guy,\" she said in one defiant moment. \"I'm going to keep making jokes about this guy.\"\n\nRepublican Party spokesman Mike Reed called the press conference a \"desperate attempt\" to change the conversation.\n\n\"Kathy Griffin's career was over long before she attempted to make a disgusting joke about decapitating the President,\" Reed said. \"What she did was wrong and President Trump and his family have every right to condemn it.\"\n\nThe California GOP later sent out a fundraising email calling Griffin's photo shoot disrespectful and obscene.\n\nGriffin appeared surprised at the number of cameras and reporters in a packed conference room at her lawyer's office, her hands shaking at one point when she took a sip of water. She switched between contriteness to combativeness during the press conference, during which she attempted several nervous jokes that drew laughs mostly from her attorney, Lisa Bloom.\n\nBloom said the comedian has a First Amendment right to make fun of the president.\n\n\"Whether or not you get, or like, her artistic expression, in America, Kathy has the right to parody the president,\" Bloom said. \"She never imagined it would be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against Trump.\"\n\nBloom, a former truTV anchor and lawyer Gloria Allred's daughter, has represented Wendy Walsh, who has accused former Fox News Channel personality Bill O'Reilly of hurting her career after she spurned his advances. O'Reilly has denied the accusations\n\nBacklash against Griffin has continued to grow. Griffin said five of her performances have been canceled this week.\n\nVenues in New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and California canceled upcoming shows. The Community Arts Theater in Williamsport, Pa., posted on its website that the show had been dropped \"due to the recent controversy surrounding Kathy Griffin and the concern for the safety and security of our patrons and staff.\"\n\nSen. Al Franken also dis-invited Griffin from an event promoting his new book, \"Giant of the Senate.\"\n\n\"After hearing from many Minnesotans who were rightfully offended, I've come to the conclusion that it would be best for her not to participate in the event we had previously scheduled,\" the Minnesota Democrat said Thursday, a day after he had said she was still welcome. \"I understand why Minnesotans were upset by this, and I take that very seriously.\"\n\nHe said what Griffin did \"was inappropriate and not something that should be anywhere in our national discourse.\"\n\nAn endorsement deal with Squatty Potty also ended.\n\nThough Griffin apologized within hours of the images appearing online Tuesday, they were met with swift and widespread condemnation.\n\nTrump later tweeted that Griffin \"should be ashamed of herself\" for posting the images.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Thursday called Griffin \"disgusting\" and said the photo was \"completely outrageous.\"\n\nEven Anderson Cooper, her CNN co-host for the New Year's Eve show, condemned the images. Griffin said she has not spoken to Cooper since, and appeared visibly upset and struggled to speak when fielding questions about Cooper.\n\nThe comic has faced controversies before for her abrasive humor, but none as widespread as the one generated by Tuesday's images.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Griffin accused the Trumps of \"trying to ruin my life forever,\" not \"my rights.\"\n\nAP writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this story.\n\nCNN fires Kathy Griffin from New Year's show after Donald Trump beheading stunt\n",

Jack Antonoff, who worked with Swift on her last album, 1989, co-wrote and co-produced the dance-pop song, which includes an interpolation of Right Said Fred's \"I'm Too Sexy.\"\n\n\"I don't like your little games/ I don't like your tilted stage,\" Swift viciously sings. \"The role you made me play: of the fool/ No, I don't like you.\" Later, she sings, \"The world moves on / Another day another drama, drama / But not for me, Not for me / All I think about is karma.\"\n\nTowards the end of the song, Swift uses an effect that approximates singing through a phone. \"The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now,\" she says. \"Why?/ 'Cause she's dead.\"\n\n\nWhile not mentioning Kanye West by name, the song's lyrics (West notably used a tilted stage on his recent Saint Pablo tour) alongside the phone voice appear to reference her long, public feud with the rapper. The beef was revived last year after West's song \"Famous\" included the lyric: \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why? I made that bitch famous.\" West's accompanying video feature Swift's likeness naked in bed with other naked celebrities. Swift denounced the song upon its release, taking issue with being called a \"bitch\" and West taking credit for her success. Months later, West's wife Kim Kardashian leaked video and audio of West and Swift's phone conversation, seemingly confirming that Swift was aware of some of West's lyrics about her in private. There was no recording, however, of Swift listening to and approving \"I made that bitch famous.\"\n\n \nTaylor Swift vs. Kanye West: A Beef History\nFrom \"I'mma let you finish\" to \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" we recap pop's most high-profile feud\nAfter the song's release, certain listeners questioned the timing of the album, as Swift's November 10th release date lands on the same day as the 10th anniversary of the death of Kanye West's mother Donda. A source at Big Machine Records, Swift's record label, however, denies any correlation to Rolling Stone. \"It is standard practice that releases come out on Fridays and we locked in this release date based on other Universal Music Group releases,\" the source says. \"There is no correlation.\"\n\nPrior to \"Famous,\" Swift and West made amends both publicly and privately following their initial rumble at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards where West hijacked the stage during Swift's acceptance speech for Best Female Video to say that Beyonc\u00e9 should have won. The gaffe was so shocking, even President Barack Obama weighed in, calling West \"a jackass\" for interrupting the singer. Swift's Speak Now ballad \"Innocent\" is about that event. \"I think a lot of people expected me to write a song about [West],\" she told MTV at the time. \"But, for me, it was important to write a song to him.\"\n\nReputation will be released on November 10th and is available for pre-order. Swift has partnered with Target to release two 72-page magazines alongside the album that will include \"personal poetry and photos, artwork by Taylor, handwritten lyrics, exclusive poster\" and photos from the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" video shoot. \n\n\nWhile the singer-songwriter has yet to reveal specific tour dates, she also announced a partnership with Ticketmaster Verified Fan, a new program that attempts to block scalpers and bots from obtaining tickets. The singer also released a video explaining the process.\n\nSince wrapping her 1989 world tour at the end of 2015, Swift took on more background roles in music. She co-wrote Little Big Town's \"Better Man\" and Calvin Harris' \"This Is What You Came For,\" which features Rihanna on lead vocals. She also collaborated with Zayn Malik on the hit song \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever,\" from the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack.\n\n\n",

When Pratt spoke to Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show Friday, he said that he and Faris, both professional actors, take parenting, specifically story time, very seriously.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re strangely competitive with each other when it comes to entertaining him and getting into the characters,\u201d he said, before recounting a recent bedtime-story moment: \u201cWe were reading this book, and I\u2019ll start affecting a little accent for the character, and then she\u2019s like, \u2018Oh,\u2019 and she starts gesticulating and laughing.\u201d\n\nPratt said that Jack seemed to pay no interest to his parents\u2019 competing dramatics. But when some version of method acting is happening in your bedroom every night, it\u2019s pretty difficult not to pick up on it.\n\nIt helps, too, when your parents trick you in to making an everyday occurrence something out of Lee Strasberg\u2019s lesson plan. When Jack was just three, Faris told Conan O\u2019Brien that she was teaching her toddler to have big, stage-worthy, emotional reactions to everyday events.\n\nJack seems to come by some very valuable talents naturally, though. In a 2015 interview with Ellen, Pratt told the talk-show host that he often comes to his young son for sound advice. He shared a story of how Jack picked up on tension at a family holiday gathering.\n\n\u201cHe says amazing things, profound things,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cI was sitting down and I said, \u2018You know, Jack, there's a lot of people here, and it\u2019s very loud, and people are gonna be having a lot of fun. And there might even be some tension.\u2019 And he just said, \u2018It\u2019s family.\u2019 I almost started crying. I was like, \u2018Thank you, son; you\u2019re right.\u2019 He\u2019s like my therapist.\u201d\n\nJack is clearly already a perceptive kid\u2014another essential trait for a successful career in theater. Combine that with his parents\u2019 affinity for inundating him with classic Hollywood films, and his acting career will be blossoming before we know it.\n",

    "text": "\nLast night, the world officially went into meltdown after Beyonc\u00e9 announced she and Jay Z were expecting twins.\n\nWith the help of contemporary artist Awol Erizku, Queen Bee shared her exciting news on social media, showing the veiled mother-to-be caressing her stomach, surrounded by reams of flowers, in what has now become the most liked Instagram picture of all time.\n\nHours later, the rumour mill went into overdrive, with several conspiracy theories popping up.\n\nSome of them questioning the timing of her announcement, others interpreting the Instagram post like its a James Joyce epic poem. Soon, there will be more illuminati claims and eventually someone is bound to figure that she's not really pregnant at all and that it was all a ruse.\n\nLet's have a look at the ideas that have been floated so far.\n\nFirstly, many astute BeyHive fans were quick to point out the Lemonade star might have given us a hint about her pregnancy via Instagram six weeks ago.\n\nIn a post to Instagram before Christmas, the 'Halo' singer shared a slideshow of photos of herself in a suede navy dress and silver antlers, which show her in back-to-back photos appearing to hold her stomach.\n\nIn the clip, the star can be seen holding up a peace sign \u2013 or a number two \u2013 before making a heart shape with her hands.\n\nWhile it's plausible to believe the singer was simply sharing a message of peace and love to her fans during the festive seasons, rumours of the hidden baby announcement have now taken Twitter by storm.\n\nMeanwhile, other Bey fans are suspicious of the pregnancy news' timing.\n\nNext week, Beyonce will attend the 59th Annual Grammy Awards \u2013 an occasion particularly close to the singer's heart given the fact she's amassed 53 nominations and 20 wins over the years.\n\nFollowing the unprecedented success of her sixth studio album Lemonade, which has been nominated for staggering nine Grammy awards this year, some fans are thinking her well-timed pregnancy announcement to be a clever PR stunt to prevent the news detracting from her award-winning album and Grammy performance.\n\nAfter all, when Beyonce opened her jacket to confirm her pregnancy following her rendition of Love On Top at the VMAs in 2011, it was this gesture \u2013 rather than the song \u2013 that naturally caught the world's attention.\n\nIt is, of course, reasonable to assume that one of the most famous women in the world might have put some thought into the perfect way to time her pregnancy announcement to the world.\n\nBut some of the theories that developed during her first pregnancy reached hilarious levels of fantasy.\n\nLet's not forget that when Ms. Knowles-Carter announced her first pregnancy with the now-five-year-old Blue Ivy Carter, many people believed it to be fake, with talk of a shifting stomach during an appearance on an Australian television show and suspicion as to the lack of pregnancy photos before the birth.\n\nThis is the same woman who openly spoke out about the heartache of suffering a miscarriage before falling pregnancy with her first child, admitting the sound of her baby's heartbeat was 'the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life', during her HBO documentary Life Is But a Dream.\n\nWhile it's unknown how far along the singer is in her second pregnancy, it's fairly traditional for a woman to keep the news hush hush until she's out of the first trimester.\n\nPerhaps it is also worth considering that Beyonce and Jay Z might have been cautious in sharing the news of their family growing at a time when civil, reproductive and women's rights are currently under threat by the Trump administration in the US.\n\nIn all fairness to Beyonc\u00e9 though, she's allowed to announce her news whenever she damn pleases really.\n\nJust look at Adele and Eva Mendes, who kept their pregnancies quiet until the actual births, making a statement about the fact that, even though celebrities are in the public eye, they and their families are not public property.\n\nSome conspiracy theories can be quite fun, admittedly, mostly when they are completely inconceivable or bizarre, but for now, let's focus on the fact Queen Bee is about to welcome two of the coolest kids to the planet.",

I guess I am a little bit stronger,\u201d the actress, director and philanthropist tells PEOPLE exclusively in an interview for the magazine\u2019s new cover story. \u201cWe all have our difficult times, but as a mother you also have a responsibility first and foremost towards the kids.

Everything was just stopped. I\u2019m really sitting and talking with them because everything affects them. Every location, every type of project, I\u2019m going to have to adjust it to however much they can handle.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, an emotional Jolie also talks about how she misses her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who died of cancer 10 years ago, more than ever \u2014and says her own health is good \u201cso far\u201d after her preventative surgeries to lessen the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nShe\u2019s very proud that Maddox and Pax got involved behind the scenes on First They Killed My Father. The movie grew from her longtime love for Cambodia, where she adopted Maddox in 2002 and where she has done humanitarian work for 14 years, establishing a foundation in Maddox\u2019s name that helps local communities with education, health and more. \u201cI wanted Maddox to see how extraordinary his country is,\u201d she says of the movie.\n\nThough they are still healing from the last year, the star says her family is out of \u201clockdown\u201d and ready for new adventures.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re itching to get out in the world again,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been a bit in lockdown and going through some things. I think it would be good to get out there and play together.\u201d\n",

They are just looking at the final details now like public holidays.'\n\nJust yesterday, lawyers for Madonna demanded that the star's ex-husband Guy Ritchie be arrested for contempt of court for not abiding terms agreed in their divorce in 2008.\n\nHer legal team made the dramatic demand during a bitter court hearing in New York which both she and Ritchie were listening to by phone.\n\nMadonna's lawyer Eleanor Alter said that Ritchie should have brought Rocco to New York to resolve the dispute, because he was required to according to terms in the legally-binding divorce.\n\nShe said: 'He taught his son that obeying court orders was not important and I think that's one of the most serious things that's happened in this case that's detrimental to Rocco.'\n\nAlter said that Ritchie's conduct was 'contempt' and the court went so far as to discuss the possibility that a warrant could be issued for Ritchie's arrest.\n\nShe added that the contempt should be enforced but New York Supreme Court Justice Deborah Kaplan refused to issue the warrant for Ritchie's arrest.\n\nRitchie's lawyer Peter Bronstein angrily rejected the demand from Madonna's team and said that his client had not even been held in contempt so an arrest was not being considered yet.\n\nJustice Kaplan scolded both Ritchie and Madonna and said their son just wanted the case over.\n\nShe said: 'Frankly both parties have chosen to live their lives in a very public way and may welcome the publicity, but the child has not.\n\n'He would like this matter resolved and the issues concerning him and his family in the most private way possible'.\n\nLawyers for both sides grew increasingly ill-tempered as the hearing went on.\n\nSee more of the latest Madonna updates as she fights for custody of her son Rocco\n\nAlter, for Madonna, said that things she had been told by Mr Bronstein about English law had 'proved to be incorrect' and that some of the 'protections' she'd hoped for had not materialised.\n\nShe said that did not have an agreement on 'any part' of the case.\n\nMr Bronstein said that Ritchie and Madonna had been speaking directly to each other and by yesterday had drawn up an agreement which they had summarized into 24 points.\n\nIt broke down because of a number of issues including measures that allowed David Banda, the son Madonna adopted while married to Ritchie, to visit Rocco in London but make sure he returns to New York.\n\nMr Bronstein said there were still a 'number of differences which are extremely important to my client and, I understand, to the child'.\n\nHe went on to say that he had refrained from filing a number of papers which could be 'emotionally disturbing' to Rocco in the hope that an agreement could be reached.\n\nHe asked the court to lift Justice Kaplan's order from December requiring that Rocco return to New York but she rebuffed him.\n\nJustice Kaplan told him that under the terms of Madonna and Ritchie's divorce, which was agreed in London in 2008, the Manhattan Supreme Court had ultimate authority over any custody matters, not the High Court in London.\n\nInstead Ritchie has been going to the London court for hearings over the row, the court was told. Another one was due to take place in London on Thursday.\n\nJustice Kaplan urged both sides not to take up what she called 'entrenched' positions and think about what was 'best for the child'.\n\nShe said that she thought that both parties were 'coming very very close to a global resolution that would take the child out of the unending spotlight'.\n\nAlter seized on this and said that Ritchie's conduct amounted to contempt. She said: 'He thought it was better for Rocco to live with him.\n\n'He may be right, I don't know. But the proper procedure was to come back to New York and ask for a change in circumstances. He used self-help.\n\n'He taught his son that obeying court orders was not important and I think that's one of the most serious things that's happened in this case that's detrimental to Rocco.'\n\nMr Bronstein said that the mere suggestion Ritchie could be arrested cast a 'dark pall' over the hearing and said that the boy should be able to live in a 'normal household' with his father present.\n\nRocco's lawyer Ellen Sigal said that the teenager wanted his parents to 'put in place measures that will heal the rift that has arisen'.\n\nShe said that the case was proving to be a 'very difficult' time for him and that that she hoped he would not be exposed to any more 'distress and innuendo'.\n\nShe said that Rocco felt that the case was 'stressful and upsetting'. He is currently attending school in London and that she hoped Rocco's parents 'come to an agreement that will shield him from this matter'.\n\nMadonna appeared by phone from New Zealand where she is due to play the next date in her Rebel Heart tour. Ritchie's location was not disclosed but is likely to have been London.\n\nShe spoke only at the start of hearing when asked: 'Is that Miss Ciccone?' and she replied: 'Yes, it's me.'\n\nRitchie only spoke to confirm he was on the phone too.\n\nEarlier Justice Kaplan had agreed to let the press remain in the court because she did not believe that coverage of the case would cause a 'negative impact' to Rocco.\n\nShe said that the case had attracted 'extraordinary' media attention and that she had to balance the need for public access with the 'harmful effects' on Rocco.\n\nThe judge also allowed a single photographer in to take still photos of the hearing.\n\nThe case is to resume on 1 June.\n\nThe couple were married in Skibo Castle in Scotland in a high profile ceremony attended by Gwyneth Paltrow, Donatella Versace and Stella McCartney.\n\nMadonna is also the mother to 19-year-old daughter Lourdes Leon, from her previous relationship to Carlos Leon, and adopted children David Banda, 10, and Mercy James, also 10 - David was adopted while she was still married to Guy.\n\nGuy, meanwhile, has gone on to have three children with wife Jacqui Ainsley: sons Rafael, four, and Levi, one, and daughter Rivka, three.\n\nRitchie had been seen walking in London before the case was heard.\n\nHe and his superstar singer ex have been embroiled in a bitter legal battle over their teenager for the past few months.\n\nMadonna has used social media to attempt to appeal to her son.\n\nTwo weeks ago she shared a nostalgic snapshot of herself with baby Rocco, reminiscing about happier times.\n\nAlong with the snap, she wrote, 'Tu me manque............(sic)', translated as 'I miss you'.\n\nWhile some of her French fans were quick to point out that she had spelt 'manques' wrong, most of her followers chimed in with messages of love and support, reassuring the star that Rocco would no doubt change his mind.\n\n'Be strong he will come back, he is just a teenager', one posted, while another enthused, 'He will always be your son and you always his mother'.\n\nRocco is said to have moved in which his father, 47, his model wife Jacqui Ainsley, 34, and their three children after becoming fed up with being on tour with his mother.\n\nHe was supposed to spend Christmas with her but did not return home to New York.\n\nMadonna went to the Manhattan Supreme Court in December to try to force Rocco to come home.\n\nBut during the hearing Ritchie's lawyer Eric Buckley said that Rocco had 'expressed very clearly' that he did not want to be with her.\n\nOne possible source of Rocco's frustration is that Madonna posted numerous pictures and videos of him on Instagram that could have caused him embarrassment.\n\nIn May she posted one video of him doing a backflip wearing orange underwear with the caption 'Rocco's preferred profile #nosausage'.\n\nIn an interview in August Madonna said that Rocco did not want to perform on stage with her and would be working backstage on her tour as 'your mom is not cool' at his age.\n\nThe row has reopened old wounds from her and Guy's divorce after eight years together and put Madonna at the center of a painful and public battle.\n\nMadonna reportedly thinks Guy's parenting is too lax and is said to have hired private detectives to spy on Rocco, who took pictures of him smoking underage.\n",

A new report claims that Cyrus and Hemsworth had a huge fight over their supposed prenup while they were making their wedding plans.\n\nAccording to the report, Cyrus, 24, and Hemsworth, 27, have been planning their wedding in the Himalayan Mountains this summer. But there has reportedly been tension between them over having a prenup. Cyrus reportedly told Hemsworth she wanted him to sign a prenup before they got married so she could protect her estimated $200 million net worth.

He told me about it - it was when she was married to Brad Pitt.'\n\nA rep for Jennifer has strenuously denied the story, saying:\u00a0I have commented in the National Enquirer and others. It's 100 percent false.\n\n'Jennifer has never had a romantic or sexual relationship with Matt LeBlanc.'\n\nThe pair, who played Joey and Rachel on the global hit comedy, started a romance on screen at the end of season nine in May 2003 and the beginning of season 10.\n\nRachel starts to develop feelings for her friend who lives across the hall, and has dreams about him.\n\nAfter Joey sees Charile (Aisha Wheeler) kiss Ross (David Schwimmer) he decides to go ahead with a relationship with Rachel, after she had confessed how she feels.\n\nIn season 10, which concluded in May 2004, the pair attempt to consummate their love, but fail and decide to remain friends.\n\nPaul, who is estranged from his son, did not confirm at what point Matt and Jennifer are supposed to have got together in real life.\n\nThe Cake star was married to Brad, from 2000 to 2005.\n\nMeanwhile Matt was with his ex wife Melissa McKnight - the pair tied the knot in 2003, after being together since 1997. They split in 2006.\n\nBrad and Jen broke up after the 51-year-old actor made the movie Mr and Mrs Smith with his now wife Angelina Jolie.\n\nThe 40-year-old actress said in 2006 she met and fell in love with the Oceans Eleven star on the set of the movie, telling Vogue that they did not pursue anything romantically until he had announced his separation with Jennifer.\n\nShe said: 'It took until, really, the end of the shoot for us, I think, to realize that it might mean something more than we'd earlier allowed ourselves to believe.\n\n'And both knowing that the reality of that was a big thing, something that was going to take a lot of serious consideration.'\n\nThe couple now have six children together, Maddox, 13, Pax, 11, Zahara, 10, Shiloh, nine, and twins Knox and Vivienne, who just turned seven.\n\nJennifer told the Hollywood Reporter\u00a0some years after the break-up:\u00a0'Nobody did anything wrong. 'You know what I mean?\n\n'It was just like, sometimes things [happen]. If the world only could just stop with the stupid, soap-opera b******t. There's no story.

News. \"There was never any question that Ben would be there. All the dads went along, and it would have been strange for the kids not to have their dad there.\"\nIf Baker's Bay sounds familiar, that's because it's the same Caribbean island the family visited after they announced their separation in 2015. But they've been going there for years, even before that.\n\nOf course, with the vacation comes plenty of speculation regarding their relationship status. However, our insider confirms, \"They are not getting back together at all. They are both moving on, but will continue doing things together as a family.\"\n\nWe're told Ben wasn't there the entire time. Rather, he came for a few days toward the end of the trip.\n\nAs for the getaway, another source dished, \"They stayed in the same house they always stay at. It's beachfront and beautiful. It's an annual tradition for them when the kids get out of school to come for a long vacation. It's very relaxing, and they can feel like they're on island time with nowhere to go and nobody they need to see.\"\n\nSo what did they do?\n\nOur insider added, \"The kids spent a lot of time on the beach swimming and playing in the sand with their friends. They also swam in the pool at the house and visited the club. Ben and Jen both worked out at the gym daily.\"\n\nThe former couple has always been very vocal that co-parenting their three children is their No.1 priority, and they will remain united as a team to do so.\n\n\"We are definitely a modern family,\" Jen told Today last summer. \"You don't have a choice,\" she added, admitting that while their new normal might look unusual to some, they're actually \"doing really well.\"\nBen reiterated that statement when he told E! News, \"Jen is a superhero mom. She is an amazing mother, and I'm really lucky to have her as a partner to co-parent these kids with.

    "text": "\nThe news that Angelina Jolie's daughter, 4-year-old Vivienne, will appear with her mother in the live-action movie Maleficent, in which Jolie plays the titular sorceress, has already sparked a predictable array of nepotism jokes. And while I'm sure Vivienne got a massive leg-up because of who her parents are, there's also something awfully fun about seeing Jolie play both with her public image as a practitioner of the dark arts, and her private life as a mom.\n\n\n\nFor more than a decade, Jolie has been saddled with a witchy reputation, one that wasn't based in Hollywood diva behavior but in small acts that assumed great proportions in the public mind. When she married co-star Jonny Lee Miller, Jolie took her vows in a T-shirt emblazoned with his name written in her own blood. And after she and actor Billy Bob Thornton wed, they famously wore matching necklaces with vials of each other's blood. Gossips tutted about a smooch Jolie laid on her brother at the Academy Awards, and the actress ran through the list of tabloid-sating provocations, dating actress Jenny Shimizu, discussing her history of self-mutilation comfortably in public, and talking about BDSM with a fluency that would set E.L. James a-scribbling.\n\n\n\nTaken together, all of the above combined to paint a portrait of a powerfully alluring woman with deep uncertainties about herself and her choices. When Brad Pitt divorced Jennifer Anniston to be with Jolie, now his fiancee after seven years and five children together, the romance provided a narrative that seemed to solidify Jolie's public image. In the pages of gossip rags she was an enchantress, a creature of blood and sex, qualities never entirely erased by her eventual transformation into mother of three children by Pitt and three others by adoption.\n\nWhich is why it's so awesome that Jolie is starring in a children's movies as a witch, rather than as a princess or a warrior. Witches may bear the weight of public disapproval, but the hero often needs them at the beginning of the journey, and the adventure often involves the hero learning to see the world with some of the wisdom and disappointment that inform the witch's perspective. But even in movies with bad-ass princesses like Brave's Merida, the witch who gets consulted halfway through the story is a wizened old crone with a fondness for whittling. Outside the sympathetic librettos of Stephen Sondheim, witches don't really even get much of a chance to compete for the title of hero.\n\nSo I've loved seeing Jolie don horns and fly around in harnesses in set photos from Maleficent. And I'm even more excited that she'll be bringing her daughter to work with her. The movie's a reminder that we should consider sympathizing with the witches a little bit more frequently. And Vivienne's appearance is a joke on all the people\u2014including Jolie's father, Jon Voight\u2014 who suggested Jolie was an unfit mother. Witches don't just lock adorable blonde princesses in towers. Sometimes, they give birth to them.\n\n\n",

    "text": "\nIt's not totally clear what's going on with Kanye West. The rapper, who was filmed delivering onstage rants during recent shows in California, on Monday\u00a0canceled the remaining 21 dates in his Saint Pablo tour. Hours later, he was reportedly hospitalized for stress and exhaustion.\n\nWest spent the night at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for his own safety,\u00a0the Associated Press reported. Police, without confirming the patient as West, told AP that the\u00a0officers arrived at a West Hollywood home for a disturbance, and an ambulance took the patient to the hospital to be placed on a psychiatric hold.\n\nBefore his hospitalization, West's public breakdowns and stream-of-consciousness speeches have been the subject of jokes and disdain. But recent reports about West's well-being have reopened a conversation about mental health, fame and hip-hop.\n\nThe genre\u00a0has long been characterized by notions of hyper-masculinity that allow little room for vulnerability, and of black and brown men putting forward a tough, adversarial persona. But hip-hop\u00a0has always had introspective moments (Geto Boys rapped \"My mind is playing tricks on me\" in 1991). In recent years, we've seen more artists opening\u00a0up about their emotional and mental struggles in the public eye and on\u00a0albums.\n\nEminem followed his 2009 album \"Relapse\" with one called\u00a0\"Recovery,\" after experiencing addiction and depression. DMX has rapped and spoken about suffering from bipolar disorder. In October, Kid Cudi publicly announced on his Facebook page that he checked himself into rehabilitation for his \"depression and suicidal urges,\" writing \"anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember and I never leave the house because of it.\"\n\nThis followed angry tweets directed at Drake and West.\n\nAfter it became public knowledge that Kid Cudi had checked into rehab, Drake released a song with lyrics dissing the rapper and his mental well-being. And despite the backlash against Drake online, the Toronto rapper doubled\u00a0down.\n\nBut much of the response to Kid Cudi was positive. A hashtag, #YouGoodMan, gained momentum as a conversation around masculinity, race and mental health took place on social media.\n\nOn Monday, Kid Cudi posted a list of celebrities, artists and fans who actively supported him (including\u00a0West). \"Thank you for opening your hearts and extending your love and support during a troubling time,\" he wrote.\n\nKendrick Lamar has also written and spoken about depression and the emotional tumult of being on a world tour while his best friends back home were gunned down. Much of his album \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" centers on survivor's guilt.\n\n[The sound and the fury of Kendrick Lamar at the Kennedy Center]\n\nHis lyrics were used for a Kaiser Permanente ad about depression. After a 2015 concert, Lamar saw a woman crying and murmuring \"You saved my life.\" She told him she was going to kill herself a year ago, but his music helped her through.\n\nPharoahe Monch, a beloved independent artist, has been open about dealing with depression, which he has said in interviews was induced by a combination of medications he was taking\u00a0following\u00a0hospitalization for his asthma.\n\n\"At that time, it wasn't really like it was now, where you have people talking about issues readily in the public,\" he said in a 2014 interview. \"Years ago, it was just, 'Yo, you bugging. Just deal with it.'\"\n\nIn another interview, he told MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry that it was important for his 2014 album, \"PTSD,\" to include frank and vulnerable lyrics about his struggles and\u00a0the stigma of depression within the black community.\n\n\"Growing up in the community, you look at mental issues as, we're strong, and my parents were hard-working - it's something that's looked at as a weakness so you kind of push through it sometimes without even realizing what the issue might be.\"\n\nIn \"Losing My Mind,\" Pharoahe Monch raps, \"My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health/It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth.\"\n\nHe continues: \"Void, I defected, employed self annoyed/Went independent, enjoyed stealth/Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac.\"\n\nWest's\u00a0lyrics, particularly on \"Life of Pablo,\" have caused alarm among some who speculate there's more to them than bombastic exaggeration. For instance, on \"FML,\" he raps about nothing being crazier than when \"he off his Lexapro.\"\n\nBut West is not just a hip-hop artist; he is a megastar. Aside from music, he works\u00a0in the fashion industry, and is married to one of the most famous women in the world, one who has built her career off documenting every aspect of her life. West's tweets generate trending hashtags and breathless media coverage.\n\n[What Kanye West said at the VMAs, annotated (full transcript)]\n\nHis\u00a0public behavior over the years has fueled rumors among the public and\u00a0garnered\u00a0genuine concern from fans and those close to him. Much of this began after his mother's 2007 death. He has gone on Twitter rants, given rambling interviews and stormed award-show stages - most famously in 2009, when he interrupted Taylor Swift's MTV Video Music Award acceptance speech, turning him into a pariah and punchline.\n\nRhymefest, who has co-written West tracks for years, announced in February that he had stopped collaborating with the Chicago artist a month earlier after his work on \"Life of Pablo\" was complete. \"His mind and spirit isn't right,\" Rhymefest\u00a0tweeted. He also tweeted, \"I love my brother. I pray for his health not our entertainment.\"\n\nLast week, West brought a Sacramento concert to a halt with an onstage speech that went after, among other things,\u00a0Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9, Hillary Clinton, MTV and Facebook.\u00a0When the news of his hospitalization broke Monday night, celebrities and artists immediately\u00a0offered words of support.\n\n\"I want to extend a very special prayer to my big brother, Kanye West,\" Chance the Rapper, a West collaborator, said in the middle of a performance on BBC Radio 1. \"I want to just extend this prayer and extend this love from all the way in Britain. We might come back early to come see this man.\"\n\nProducer 9th Wonder tweeted, \"been knowing the brother upwards of 13 years. Mental health is a serious thing, no matter what.\"\n",

After all, the heart wants what it wants ( wink wink ).\n\nIn photos obtained by Elle , Selena's assistant Theresa Mingus was spotted on Thursday picking up the exact same Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy that Selena saw last weekend. Later, Theresa was seen delivering the pup to the \"Fetish\" singer's apartment. A fan account on Twitter also posted pictures from the store before Theresa picked up the puppy, in which a sign reading \"I'm going HOME soon!\" posted to the dog's kennel.\n\nWhile many of Selena's fans expressed their excitement on social media for the newest addition to her family, others were disappointed because they're assuming she chose to purchase the dog from a pet store, many of which are notorious for selling puppies raised in unethical puppy mills , rather than adopting one from a shelter. \"Why buy instead of adopting this makes me so mad,\" one Twitter user wrote . In an Instagram comment screenshot by another Insta user, one person wrote , \"I also can't believe you would buy a puppy from the pet stores that are breeding and putting animals in glass and have them in bad living situations. Don't support stuff like that girl. Thought you knew better.\" It has not been confirmed where the pet store Selena's puppy is from gets its animals, and Selena's team has not confirmed or denied any information about the animal at this time.\n\nFans are also wondering whether the dog belongs solely to Selena\u2014who had rescued five shelter dogs as of 2010, according to People \u2014or if Abelena are co-parenting the pooch. If it's the latter, they won't be alone: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, who have been dating since December, adopted a husky puppy together just last weekend and have already set up an Instagram account for Porky Basquiat.\n\n",

The host got very choked up and emotional talking about his struggle with dyslexia and how she recently got some news that he\u2019s on the winning end of that struggle.\n\n \nA Message from American Family Insurance\nGet Started with the Right Support\nDream's don't take Saturday's off. Neither do we. With the right support, any dream is possible.\n\u201cA lot of you that watch the show know he has dyslexia, so school has always been a very big challenge for us in our household,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I went to his new school for a parent-teacher conference\u2026 he\u2019s getting straight A\u2019s. And so I broke down crying in the middle of the parent-teacher conference.\u201d\n\nThe star, who Us Weekly notes is a mom to Michael, 20, and Lola, 16, as well, joked that the teachers saw her crying and felt the need to reassure her that they just delivered good news.\n\n\u201cI had to wait three kids to hear these words.\u201d\n\nShe went on to explain that her son received word of his grades before she did, but managed to keep them a secret from her so that she\u2019d be surprised when the big moment came. However, when it did, he laughed uncomfortably while she cried tears of joy. While the 47-year-old host fought back her tears on set, Seacrest tried to share some inspiring words with her, but couldn\u2019t handle seeing her cry.\n\n\u201cI see the way you handle career, and most importantly family\u2026 and it\u2019s so impressive,\u201d he said of Ripa and her husband, Mark Consuelos. \u201cI am inspired by it, and anybody who knows you and watches you agrees. When my mom cries, it makes me cry, so when you cry, it makes me cry\u2026 It\u2019s like a trigger.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Ripa has gushed publicly over her son\u2019s academic achievements. In June, she posted a photo of her whole family celebrating Joaquin\u2019s graduation from middle school. The family posed together surrounding the youngster in his green cap and gown. Later, they celebrated the big occasion with a star-studded party.\n\nNow it seems that the family has something else to celebrate given Joaquin\u2019s impressive performance in high school so far.\n",

According to Entertainment Tonight, Chris Pratt was spotted at the Los Angeles parish of Hillsong Church, a hotspot that's frequented by Bieber and Kourtney Kardashian.\nThis is only the second Pratt sighting since the Guardians of the Galaxy star and his wife, Anna Faris, announced their separation after being married for eight years. Last month, Pratt made an appearance at the Teen Choice Awards, sans Faris, to accept the surfboard trophy for Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actor.\nWhile ET doesn't mention whether or not the stars mingled or even knew that they were in the same congregation, Pratt attended the same evening service as both Bieber and Kardashian that night.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the mega church that is Hillsong, it's an Australian import and its pastor, Carl Lentz, is one of Bieber's closest confidants. In addition to having services in Australia, the church has expanded with branches in New York City, Los Angeles, and London. Stars are flocking to the church and its parishioners include a slew of reality stars, such as the Kardashian-Jenner sisters; Nick Jonas; Bieber's ex, Selena Gomez; and pro athletes such as Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.\n\nAccording to People, Pratt \"redefined\" his connection to Christianity after the birth of his son, Jack, in 2012. He told the publication that he and Faris prayed extensively during Jack's time in the NICU, since he was born nine weeks premature. Back in 2016, Pratt helped his pals place a huge cross on their property in Texas, telling Stephen Colbert on The Late Show that it was \"what Jesus was doing 2000-something years before on a Saturday before Easter, [he] was carrying a cross up a hill.\"\n",

The couple famously met on set of Mr & Mrs Smith in 2004 while\u00a0Brad was already married to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and they sparked a media frenzy when Brad left Jen and pursued a relationship with Ange a short while later.\n\nIt might sound like an EastEnders-worthy love triangle, but it was all very real for Jen, and Brangelina happened for a good thirteen\u00a0years before it suddenly broke down at the end of last year.\n\nBut anyone gunning for a friendly reunion between Brad and Jen (is Bren a thing?) after all these years may finally get their wish, as it has been reported that the two are 'texting' amidst Brad's divorce from Angelina.\n\nAccording to US Weekly, Brad reached out to Jen to wish her a happy 48th birthday in February and the former couple started making baby steps to rebuilding their broken relationship.\n\nA source told the publication: 'They started talking once he wished her a happy birthday.\n\n'Brad's told her he's having a hard time with his split and they exchanged a few\u00a0texts reminiscing about the past.'\n\nHowever, anyone hoping that Bren is going to happen again will be sorely disappointed. Jennifer has been married to Justin Theroux since 2015 and\u00a0the source confirms that Justin is more than happy for his wife to be in contact with her ex.\n\n'Justin is okay with them being friends [as he knows] Jen just wanted to be nice,' the source said.\n\nWe're so glad that these two are finally in a place where they can be friends again (ahem, pun intended).\n",

Of course they do - it's Harry-blimming-Styles.\n\n\nRex Features\nThe trouble is, Harry ain't so keen, and has reportedly asked his rumoured new girlfriend Kendall Jenner NOT to film any scenes with or about him.\n\n\"Harry has told Kendall that he will not appear on Keeping Up With the Kardashians under any circumstances,\" sources told New York Daily News. \"Harry does not want his love life played out across the world on TV.\n\n\"Naturally, the producers want Harry on camera.\"\n\nThink about what would happen to those ratings\u2026\n\nOn 6 January 2014, we wrote...\n\nHarry Styles and Kendall Jenner have sent the rumour mill into overdrive, having been snapped together by a fan.\n\nThe are they/aren't they pair have been spotted skiing together and fan Allie Connolly Instgrammed her chance meeting with them at a snowboard shop in Mammoth Lakes California.\n\n\"Casually hanging out with Kendall Jenner and Harry Styles. #dying.\"\n\n[instagram id=\"ir9cKow4dA\"]\n\nHowever it seems Allie didn't expect the backlash from 1Directioners as she took to Twitter to defend the image, \"\"Lol now I have 14 year olds telling me that I was paid to make this a publicity stunt. Yep, you caught me hahahah,\" she wrote.\n\nHarry and Kendall have been spotted together on numerous occasions, first stepping out for dinner in November.\n\nYet the pair have been keen to deny rumours that they are an item with Kendal telling E!that they \"are just friends,\" and Harry telling Piers Morgan that they are not dating and just went out for dinner.\n\nOn 16 December 2013, we wrote...\n\nAnother day, another picture emerging that suggests this Harry Styles/Kendall Jenner thing could be for real.\n\n\nRex Features\nDressed in a plaid shirt, blazer and jeans (after his Keith Richards-inspired headband and crucifix earring get-up on The X Factor), Styles was snapped arriving at Kendall's London hotel in the early hours of Sunday morning, after flying in from France where the band appeared at the NRJ Awards.\n\nThe pair have been romantically linked ever since they were seen leaving a restaurant together in Hollywood a month ago. Since then, they've been seen leaving a NYC hotel together and on a few restaurant dates, and they've followed each other on Instagram - which means they're practically MARRIED in celeb-ville.\n\nKendall took to Instagram to document her time in London - including this rather pretty picture of Big Ben:\n\n\nKendall and Harry have both been coy when asked about the relationship, insisting they are nothing more than friends. Question is, how many dinner dates/hotel visits will we hear about until 'Kenry' make their romance official?\n\nOn Tuesday, 10 December, we wrote...\n\nMore details have emerged regarding that Harry/Kendall date the One Direction star and budding model supposedly went on over the weekend.\n\n\nSplash News\nAccording to Us Weekly, Harry took Kendall to a gay bar in NYC, Hell's Kitchen's Therapy, for a special themed-night entitled \"Gays Gone Wild\".\n\nThe source added that Harry is a regular at said haunt, and although the pair didn't hit the dancefloor, he left \"holding hands\" with Kendall when the One Direction hit What Makes You Beautiful came on - for fear of the pair being recognised.\n\nEarlier the same day, 'Kenry' caused a frenzy outside of NYC's Gansevoort hotel when they were pictured leaving together.\n\nWith Harry (who was in town for his performance on SNL) dressed in a peacoat and bandana, and Kendall in a crop top, jeans and military jacket, the pair were swamped by fans as they left the hotel to get breakfast. They have reportedly stayed in touch ever since the American Music Awards, with a source telling E! News:\n\n\"I've never seen Kendall happier and more fan friendly...They came off the elevator holding hands and then she stood and watched while he posed with fans.\"\n\nAlthough both have vaguely denied the dating rumours (Kendall simply said \"He's cool, yeah, he's cool... You go out with one person, you're automatically dating them\", whilst Harry told Piers Morgan \"dunno\" when asked to confirm their relationship status), this picture will no doubt send the rumour mill into a frenzy.\n\nOn Monday 25 November, we wrote...\n\nThose Harry Styles and Kendall Jenner rumours? Probably not true, if both the parties involved are to be believed.\n\n\nAKM-GSI\nObviously the internet got a *little* carried away when the two were snapped leaving a dinner date together last week (because having dinner together = married in celeb-land), and both Kendall and Harry denied the dating rumours (if a little coyly) over the weekend.\n\nAt the AMAs, Kendall was asked by the E!'s Giuliana Rancic on the red carpet if she was indeed dating Harry. Her response?\n\n\"We're friends. He's cool, yeah, he's cool... You go out with one person, you're automatically dating them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, when quizzed on a possible romance by TV interviewer Piers Morgan, Harry said:\"I mean, we went out for dinner, but no, I guess.\"\n\nAnd when asked if a romance could be in the pipeline after the one dinner date, Styles simply replied \"dunno\".\n\nSo not exactly a complete denial - but not a glowing declaration of love either.\n\nStay tuned to see if 'Kenry' (yep, that's what people are calling them) really is on the cards.\n\nOn Thursday 21 November, we wrote...\n\nHas the world imploded, or did we actually just see this picture of Harry Styles and Kendall Jenner?\n\nThe One Direction star and the Kardashian sister were spotted leaving Craig's restaurant together in Hollywood last night after apparently enjoying a dinner date.\n\nKeen to keep the rendez-vous under wraps, the pair left out of a private backdoor exit. They were then seen driving away together in Styles' Range Rover.\n\nThe pair met at the X Factor USA studios, where One Direction recorded their performance for the show this evening (or so says Unreality TV).\n\n\nIt may be a little premature to assume that these two are officially an item, but the Mail Online have already Christened the pair Kenry (the new Kimye, y'all), so we're kind of hoping we're set to see a trans-Atlantic teen power-couple confirm their romance in the coming weeks.\n",

    "text": "\nTaylor Swift has officially returned. This morning, after a social media blackout followed closely by cryptic clips of a coiling, striking snake, Swift pulled back the curtain on her forthcoming album, Reputation \u2014which expects a November 10 release, according to a subsequent frame\u2014with a stark black and white beauty shot featuring a new take on her trademark beauty look.\n\nGone are the bangs, the polished bob , and the fringed shag . In their place, the singer debuts a dampened mane of soft, finger-raked waves, with a hint of James Dean volume at the crown. The homage makes sense: the singer's portrait strikes a rebellious note, from her posturing to the silver chain choker around her neck. And though makeup is still present, Swift's painted matte lip looks more femme fatale than ladylike, coupled with bare skin and long eyelashes. Considering the album's telling title, and the clever repurposing of social media's favorite snake emoji, it seems Swift is taking her image into her own hands. So far, devil-may-care looks good on the pop star.\n\n",

    "text": "\nThe men's restroom of the Landmark Theatres in West L.A. is as good a place as any to gauge the true sentiments of Oscar voters. Following a showing of Hacksaw Ridge a few Saturdays ago, I found myself washing my hands next to two gentlemen \u2014 both appeared to be about 63, the average age of Academy members, with one wearing a Kung Fu Panda 2 cap (the kind of hat a grown man doesn't wear unless he worked on the movie) discussing what they had just seen. \"Didn't want to like that one but ... ,\" the first man said, trailing off. \"But Mel can direct,\" the friend finished.\n\nI knew instantly why they were conflicted. This season, admiration for Hacksaw Ridge as an emotional and deftly staged World War II action drama has come despite the fact that its filmmaker has made anti-Semitic and misogynistic comments. Hacksaw is one of several films in the awards race featuring marquee talent with personal issues in their pasts, highlighting the age-old concern of whether voters should judge the man (and yes, they're all men in this situation), his work or a combination of both?\n\nLike my two restroom pals, awards voters so far this season have been embracing Gibson. Hacksaw Ridge has landed on the AFI top 10 list and earned seven Critics' Choice and three Golden Globe noms, including best picture (drama) and best director for Gibson. It's a pretty remarkable turn for a filmmaker who, just six years ago, was fired by his own agents.\n\nAt the same time, awards bodies (aside from the NAACP, which nominated it for six Image Awards) and critics groups have ignored The Birth of a Nation, a film that just 11 months ago was lauded by many tastemakers as a sure-fire best picture nominee and the antidote to #OscarsSoWhite. But that was before the details of filmmaker-star Nate Parker's college rape trial resurfaced this summer, along with the news that his accuser had committed suicide. So low have Birth's awards prospects sunk that the film didn't even appear on lists of Globe or SAG Award snubs. And Fox Searchlight, which typically hosts a \"holiday party\" to allow its talent to mingle with voters, turned this season's soiree into a celebration of Jackie, its other contender, ignoring Birth.\n\nWhy do some personal troubles stick to movies while others seem to not bother voters? That question has arisen throughout Oscar history. Russell Crowe's assault of a BAFTA producer is said to have cost him an Oscar for 2001's A Beautiful Mind, but in 2003, Roman Polanski won best director for The Pianist even though he couldn't accept his award in person because he is a fugitive from justice after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, then 13, in 1977.\n\nThis year, these issues haven't only swirled around Gibson, Parker and, to a lesser extent, Woody Allen, whose latest film, Cafe Society, arrived at Cannes amid renewed allegations by his son Ronan Farrow that Allen had sexually abused Ronan's sister Dylan. Some have questioned why Casey Affleck, a best actor frontrunner for his powerful performance in Manchester by the Sea, has not been subject to Nate Parker-style scrutiny for the two sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him in 2010 by a female producer and a director of photography who claimed Affleck tormented them during the making of the bizarre mockumentary I'm Still Here. DP Magdalena Gorka's suit claimed she was made to suffer \"a nearly daily barrage of sexual comments, innuendo and unwelcome advances by crewmembers, within the presence and with the active encouragement of Affleck.\" Affleck denied the allegations and settled the suits for a reported $2 million. So far, he's picked up a Gotham Award and a Critics' Choice win.\n\nSome have insinuated that Parker's race played a role in his banishment, either consciously or subconsciously. And they may be right. Another factor might be the especially shocking nature of the claims against him, despite his acquittal, or his refusal in media interviews to apologize, or the fact that sexual assault is dramatized in his film. But it might also be the clubby nature of Hollywood that forgives those perceived as insiders and gives no benefit of the doubt to those who aren't. Affleck, a Hollywood presence for almost as long as his brother Ben, is an insider. Gibson, movie star and best picture winner for Braveheart, is another insider. He was sent to directors jail for a decade before reemerging this year, and voters seem to be saying enough time has passed. Also, his movie is really good.\n\nThis time of year, it's all about getting voters to actually see the contenders. And while one Oscar-nominated producer recently told me he felt an \"ickiness\" when deciding to pop in his Hacksaw screener, he did it anyway and liked the film. This same producer didn't think twice about watching Manchester. But, like many, he hasn't even bothered to open his Birth of a Nation screener.\n\n\n",

She now lives in their mansion in Montville Township, N.J., the only one of several homes they still own.\n\nUnder a plea agreement, Joe Giudice admitted guilt to multiple counts of bankruptcy fraud.\u00a0He also acknowledged failing to file a federal income tax return in April 2005 after making almost $245,000 in the previous year, court records say.\n\nA lawyer for Joe Giudice, Jerard Gonzalez of Hackensack, N.J., could not be reached for\u00a0comment.\n",

    "text": "\nAdopted as a baby, Michael Bay began searching for his birth parents when he was a young man. He found his biological mother and for a time his search for his biological father pointed to no less than John Frankenheimer, the auteur director of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" and other Hollywood classics.\n\nGene tests later proved Bay was not Frankenheimer's son, and the trail went cold. But in his career, Bay has two \"dads\" who share his creative DNA: Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg.\n\nHaving such hitmakers as his guides has served Bay well, and he's repaid their support handsomely. Bruckheimer served as a producer on Bay's first five films, including such hits as \"Bad Boys,\" \"The Rock\" and \"Armageddon,\" and Spielberg produced his last three, the \"Transformers\" pics. The franchise has already grossed more than $1.5 billion worldwide between the first two films, with the latest sequel expected to break box office records this weekend.\n\nHis one feature that had neither as producer, \"The Island,\" is Bay's lowest-grossing picture. (Though since DreamWorks released the film, Spielberg was involved in some capacity.)\n\nBruckheimer shepherded Bay into feature films in the mid '90s, but their relationship goes back more than 20 years. \"I saw Michael's commercial reel and thought that he had a combination of an amazing sense of humor and a great sense of visual style,\" Bruckheimer says. \"Michael did a very good video for us on 'Days of Thunder.' Even though he had only done a couple of videos at that point, it was easy to see how talented he was.\"\n\nBruckheimer expected Bay to become a big event filmmaker, he says, \"because Michael had such strong vision and the will to get it on camera.\"\n\nBruckheimer describes Bay as \"a born filmmaker,\" though the producer did work with the director to develop his \"clarity of storytelling and depth of the films' characters.\"\n\nSpielberg fills a different role than Bruckheimer in guiding Bay, since he's a director himself. Spielberg emerged from TV and the twilight of the studio system to direct blockbusters before tackling more serious pics. There are hints he sees some of himself in Bay.\n\nHe says since he started working with Bay on the \"Transformers\" pics, \"I think our relationship has gotten looser over time, in the sense that we laugh a lot more about how hard movies like 'Transformers' are to mount and make. I really believe that once the 'Transformers' franchise is out of his system, Michael will take his visual gifts and begin to apply them to many different kinds of stories, even quiet ones.\"\n\nSpielberg notes that while Bay is \"a powerful and provocative image maker,\" on this latest \"Transformers\" pic, \"Michael was very focused on telling a story more character-dependent than 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.' \"\n\nBruckheimer offers this summary of why Bay's blockbusters consistently shine at the box office.\n\n\"Michael likes taking huge audiences, packing them into a Howitzer of his own design, and firing them into the experience,\" Spielberg says. \"There are millions of people who love the thrill rides that Michael designs for them.\"\n",

    "text": "\nWhen it was announced last week that Kendall Jenner would be the new face of Est\u00e9e Lauder, a coveted contract that in the past has gone to actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow and Elizabeth Hurley and supermodels like Joan Smalls, the company did not promote the news by way of the usual public-relations machine, with news releases or email blasts.\n\nInstead, after Vogue broke the story on its website, in anticipation of a 13-page spread in the magazine, Ms. Jenner was encouraged to tell the public herself, on her own Instagram account. That post quickly garnered more than a million \"likes,\" 50,000-plus comments and many, many heart-eyed emoji.\n\nIt was the latest plum appointment for Ms. Jenner, 19, a daughter of Kris and Bruce Jenner, and a half sister to Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Kourtney Kardashian. Her seemingly meteoric rise over the last few years has taken her from a sulky minor player on the sometimes cringe-inducing but highly successful reality show \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" to a tentative career as a teenage model to the runways of the major fashion shows (Chanel, Marc Jacobs and Givenchy, among them). Along the way, she has all but redefined what it takes to become a high-profile model.\n\nMs. Jenner is tall, dark-haired, doe-eyed and beautiful. But so are hundreds of other girls who walk the runways of New York, Milan and Paris and thousands more who dream of one day doing so. What they don't have are Ms. Jenner's 16 million followers on Instagram, 9.1 million on Twitter and 7.3 million likes on Facebook (numbers that will surely have grown by the time you read this). Like many other 19-year-old girls, she uses these accounts to share photos of herself, her family and friends. Unlike many 19-year-old girls, she also uses them to plug her many partnerships and commercial projects.\n\n\"I think what's so exciting about her is that she has this social media influence along with a fashion credibility in a distinct way that speaks to millennials,\" said Jane Hertzmark Hudis, the global brand president of Est\u00e9e Lauder. \"There is really no one else like her out there.\"\nLike her older siblings, with their retail stores, fragrance lines, nail polishes and more, Ms. Jenner juggles multiple brand extensions premised on her family fame. With her younger sister, Kylie, she is marketing a collection of clothes and accessories for PacSun, one of shoes for Steve Madden's Madden Girl line and a science-fiction young adult novel set in a dystopian future colony called Indra.\n\nBut the Kardashian affiliation that first brought her to the world's attention has put her on a peculiar perch: followed by millions but navigating aversion in a cloistered industry accustomed to minting its own stars, and a historically wary - but steadily warming - relationship with the Kardashian family. (Ms. Jenner's agent and several of her clients, including Ms. Hudis, claimed not to watch \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" now filming its 10th season.)\n\n\"It's definitely two different worlds. I feel like Hannah Montana. But it's fun,\" Ms. Jenner said, referring to Miley Cyrus's character, who navigates a double life in and out of the spotlight, on the Disney sitcom that began her career and pop stardom. (Of course, both of Ms. Jenner's worlds are squarely in the public eye.)\n\nFor modeling purposes, and with a touch of wishful thinking, Ms. Jenner prefers to go by simply \"Kendall.\" In person, she is charming but terse, with a daffy sweetness if not necessarily the gift of gab.\n\nWhen she presented at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards, she famously muffed her lines, dissolving into giggles and admitting, \"Guys, I'm the worst reader.\" At a fitting at Marc Jacobs's office - during which a crowd of teenage girls gathered outside of the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of her - she was taken with a publicist's striking eye color. \"Are those your real eyes?\" she asked.\n\nShe arrived for a recent interview at her agency's office dressed model-casual: C\u00e9line slip-on sneakers, a black T-shirt and skinny pants (tag still on) by which designer she wasn't sure. They had shown up unbidden at her house, like much else, a perk not every model enjoys.\n\nShe is the first to acknowledge that she was not always interested in style. \"On Season 1 of our show, I would wear, like, neon green jeans and a white polo shirt, the craziest things,\" she said, though in her defense, when \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" premiered in 2007, Ms. Jenner was 11 years old.\n\nShe called modeling a lifelong dream. \"I would literally sit at home and have my friends take pictures of me on my little Canon camera that my mom gave me for Christmas,\" she said. \"Obviously, the show was me being in front of a camera. It's just something that I've kind of always been around.\"\nInitial forays into modeling were small in scale. In 2011, Ms. Jenner appeared in the New York Fashion Week show of Sherri Hill, a designer from Austin, Tex., who specializes in event and prom dresses.\n\nEarlier that year, Ms. Jenner's appearance at a shoot of Ms. Hill's dresses had been a plot point on an episode of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\" But Ms. Jenner's role on the show had largely been as a sidekick to her scenery-chewing sisters.\n\nWith a new agency, The Society Management, specializing in high-end fashion bookings, behind her, Ms. Jenner is now working to rebrand. \"We had to be very strategic and specific,\" she said, \"to really have people take me seriously and not mess around.\"\n\nThe perceived divide between commercial and high fashion is so wide that, when asked whether Ms. Jenner's well-documented Sherri Hill appearance had been her New York Fashion Week debut, a Society representative declined to confirm, writing, \"we recall her as still being in school during that period.\"\n\nWith a name like hers, fairly or not, there have been detractors for as long as there have been supporters.\n\n\"It always comes as a shock when I tell the story of how I casted Kendall,\" Riccardo Tisci wrote in an email about his decision to use Ms. Jenner in his Givenchy show and ad campaign. \"I didn't do it because of my links to her sister or to Kanye, as everyone seems to believe. I only chose Kendall because I thought she was amazing, a striking, dark, edgy beauty, exactly the way I like them.\"\n\nEven with prominent advocates, Ms. Jenner's rise was freighted with uncertainty. \"Her agent was very aware that she had one shot at being a credible model,\" said the stylist and Love Magazine editor Katie Grand, an early champion, who in February orchestrated Ms. Jenner's return to New York Fashion Week by placing her in Marc Jacobs's show.\n\nWhen The Society first asked her to consider Ms. Jenner, Ms. Grand was reluctant. \"I didn't even really know who she was other than someone I thought went skiing with Harry Styles once,\" she said, alluding to Ms. Jenner's alleged former beau. (The rumor mill has linked Ms. Jenner to Mr. Styles, of One Direction, and Justin Bieber, among others.)\n\nMs. Grand said her first reaction was \"underwhelmed.\" Ms. Jenner's shyness can read as standoffish, and she is still developing the presence that can distinguish a top model. Even today on the runway, she can often blend into the endless parade of willowy but indeterminable young women, without the identifiable prowl of a model like Karlie Kloss, or the seasoned charisma of one like Naomi Campbell.\n\nMs. Jenner's agent begged for one more appointment. On a follow-up visit, Ms. Grand found her less shy, more spirited and ambitious. \"There's lots of people that I've worked with at a time before they kicked into the fashion world or fashion consciousness,\" she said. \"Marc is very aware of that, because we've worked together for so long. He kind of humors me a bit. It's always a bit of an eye glaze and 'Really? Are we really going to do that?' \"\n\nThey did. Mr. Jacobs, initially skeptical, came around, largely because, Ms. Grand said, \"she looked really good in the clothes.\" The reaction, thanks in no small part to the look Ms. Jenner wore - which included a breast-baring, sheer top - was immediate. \"I was in a car on the way to the airport immediately after the show to go to London,\" Ms. Grand said. \"I was just looking through Twitter and it was everywhere. I think I didn't really realize it would be such a thing.\"\n\nBut despite the ensuing cacophony (not only from fashion blogs, but also The Daily Mail, Fox News and more), Ms. Jenner kept a limited schedule that season, walking only for Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Tisci, Giles Deacon in London (another Ms. Grand client) and Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel.\n\nMore followed. She appeared in Chanel's Couture show in July and on the cover of Ms. Grand's Love Magazine. During the Spring 2015 season in September, she expanded her show list to add Diane von Furstenberg, Tommy Hilfiger and Dolce & Gabbana, among others. She is one of a handful of models in the new Karl Lagerfeld spring ad campaign, and is said to be in spring ads for Marc Jacobs as well. (Michael Ariano, a representative for Marc Jacobs, said he could neither confirm nor deny this.)\n\nAlthough she said she was happiest to go unrecognized at castings and shows - even, in one case, being asked by a makeup artist, \"Did you know Kendall Jenner is here?\" - the media has noted her every appearance, and stoked rumors.\n\nIn Touch Weekly reported that other models, threatened by Ms. Jenner's ascendancy, taunted her by putting out cigarettes in her drink. (Ms. Jenner's representatives dispute this.) OK! Magazine splashed a runway shot and a photo of a weeping Kim across its cover under the headline, \"Kendall: 'I'm the Hot One Now!' \"\n\nThere are those in the industry who resent the intrusion of celebrity into the hermetic runway world, though Ms. Jenner's high profile largely ensures that they complain privately rather than publicly. Ms. Jenner is not the only model to make the leap - her friends Gigi Hadid, a daughter of the \"Real Housewife of Beverly Hills\" Yolanda Foster, and Hailey Baldwin, a daughter of Stephen Baldwin, have, too - but she is the most famous.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Jenner. Credit Bon Duke for The New York Times\nMs. Jenner's dual citizenship, as it were, in the realms of fashion and celebrity is a decisive factor in her appeal.\n\nAfter the announcement of her Est\u00e9e Lauder campaign, social media responded, both in favor of Ms. Jenner's appointment and opposed to it. \"@EsteeLauder Have you lost your mind...\" asked one user on Twitter. \"Do you really understand your customer base... Where did you pluck Kendall Jenner from\"?\n\nBut its executives know both who their customers are - in the United States and Europe, women as close to Kris Jenner's age as to Kendall's - and who they hope new ones might be. According to data provided by the company, on the Saturday of the announcement, Est\u00e9eLauder.com received six times the number of unique visitors as on an average Saturday. Within 48 hours of the announcement, 90 percent of visitors to the site were first-timers, 71 percent viewing the site on a mobile device.\n\n\"It speaks volumes to where we are right now in terms of nontraditional media,\" said Chris Gay, the general manager of The Society, of the Est\u00e9e Lauder campaign. \"Millennials are not into traditional media. How they're getting their media is completely fractured.\"\n\nAs models have gone from muses to marketing partners, their social presences, global reach and audience engagement have become a more important part of their appeal. \"There's no Q ratings for models,\" Mr. Gay said, referring to Q Scores, a measurement of consumer awareness of and favorability toward brands, characters and personalities. \"That was never part of the equation. But now you have real analytics.\"\n\n(The Q Scores Company does in fact track a number of models. Ms. Jenner has an awareness percentage of 33 among the general population, which puts her in line with actresses like Kerry Washington, and only 2 percentage points below Gisele B\u00fcndchen, the world's highest-paid model. Her Q score, measuring the percentage of respondents who called her one of their favorites, is 10 to Ms. B\u00fcndchen's 13.)\n\nMs. Jenner's friend Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain, depended less on analytics than personal experience when he decided, after spending time with her at Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's wedding, to cast her in his spring show.

She received plenty of good tidings from various news outlets and other actors, but the main question on everybody's lips was whether her Sex and the City co-star would express her own well wishes. The answer was yes! Sarah Jessica Parker, the Carrie Bradshaw to Cattrall's Samantha Jones, took to Instagram to very publicly declare that she was sending Cattrall love and all her very best on this, Cattrall's special day.\n\n\"Your ol' pal, fellow mischief maker, and 'sister,' Sj,\" Parker signed her note. Sister didn't really need to go in quotes, but point made. For years, there have been rumors of a feud between the two co-stars on the set of both the Sex and the City TV show as well as the two films the TV show begat. This Instagram finally put those rumors to bed.\n\nThe cause of the fight is usually pinned to money. \"The ladies reportedly had a big falling out in the show's final season when Parker was paid considerably more than Cattrall on the HBO series,\" Us Weekly notes. Us reports that their alleged disagreement over money might have caused additional problems with production on the Sex and the City films.\n\nParker and Cattrall have denied rumors of a falling out and feud for years. In November 2009, Parker told Elle, \"I don't think anybody wants to believe that I love Kim. I adore her. I wouldn't have done the movie without her.\" Cattrall, in turn, told the magazine, \"She shines and she allows you to shine as well.\"\n\nCattrall was still being asked about the supposed beef in a January 2010 interview with the Daily Mail. \"I think Sarah was right: people don't want to believe that we get on. They have too much invested in the idea of two strong, successful women fighting with each other. It makes for juicy gossip and copy. The truth of us being friends and getting along and happily doing our jobs together is where near as newsworthy. I think Sarah is fantastic. . . . She and I are sick of this. It's exhausting talking about it, and a real bore.\"\n\nWell, it's been six years since that interview. Now we have social media, which allows us to get words and images straight from celebrities' mouths with no publication acting as a middle man to possibly filter or alter their quotes. So behold an image of Kim Cattrall posted by Sarah Jessica Parker on her birthday. Look at the caption in which Parker calls Cattrall a beauty and wishes her joy and an adventure-filled year.\n\nIt's just like Carrie said: \"Friendships never go out of style.\" Or like Samantha said: \"I support you, and these bitches need to be put in their places.\"\n",

While other reports have pegged West's net worth about $100 million and Kardashian's about $40 million, TMZ says, \"[W]e're told Kim's actually worth more than Kanye.\"\n\nThe \"Yeezus\" star may fancy himself a genius, but could Kardashian's celebrity brand be bringing in more dough?\n\nThe exact sum of their net worths might be unclear, but Forbes offers some information on their annual earnings thus far. According to those figures, however, the singer is still ahead of the reality starlet.\n\nCurrently, West ranks at No. 59 on Forbes' \"Celebrity 100\" list. As of June 2013, he has made $20 million. Forbes notes that his new album and tour will certainly increase this amount.\n\nMeanwhile, Forbes ranks Kardashian at No. 66. As of June 2013, she has made $10 million from her reality show and business ventures. However, this is much lower than what she made in 2012 from cash related to her 72-day marriage to Kris Humphries. Another (made-for-TV?) wedding could be just the thing to boost that bank account back up.\n\nOn Thursday night, Kimye made their first public appearance since their engagement.

And one of the best decisions I made not only as a producer of the show, but as one of the stars of the show, was to say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to remove anything.\u2019 With that philosophy, I told the kids, \u2018Don\u2019t get on the Internet.\u2019 Now it\u2019s so amplified . . . you expect it now from the trolls.\u201d\n\nShe added that Kim Kardashian West \u201cleads the pack\u201d as the \u201cqueen of thick skin,\u201d modeling for everyone else how to face the Internet and other critics alike.\n\nAs they grow, the Kardashian grandchildren will have a whole new host of technologies to battle (imagine trolls with drones), but North just might have inherited the thick-skinned genes to handle it.

I said he's my son.\"\n\n\"In court documents, Maddox is still my son,\" he said. \"She never cleared this up.\"\n\nDespite his claims, there is no evidence that either Angelina, 41, or then-husband Billy Bob Thornton, 61 -- who was also involved in Maddox's adoption before he and Angelina divorced -- knew what Mounh did.\n\nAccording to MailOnline, Angelina has previously said she went to \"great lengths to ensure Maddox did not have a living birth mother in Cambodia\" and that she would \"never rob a mother of her child.\"\n\nMaddox's adoption took place at a time when the United States was imposing tougher restrictions on adopting kids from Cambodia because of trafficking concerns.\n\nLauryn Galindo -- the adoption agent who handled Angelina and Maddox's case -- spent time in prison after reportedly falsifying the names, birth dates and birth places of Cambodian children who were adopted by Americans. (She denied this at the time, telling ABC's \"20/20,\" \"I have never been involved or charged with anything other than paperwork errors. And that's what I pled to, that's what I'm going to go to prison for.\"\n\nWhile making his serious claims, Mounh -- who met Angelina through charity work -- also revealed he and the star have since fallen out. \"I would be happy if Cambodia didn't see her again,\" he said.\n\nAngelina was in Cambodia in February to promote \"First They Killed My Father,\" a movie she directed for Netflix about the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian genocide. Maddox worked on the film.\n\nNeither Angelina nor soon-to-be ex-husband\u00a0Brad Pitt, who legally adopted Maddox after settling down with Angelina, have commented on the claims.\n\nIn addition to Maddox, the former couple are also parents to son Pax, 13, who was adopted from Vietman; daughter Zahara, 12, who was adopted from Ethiopia; and biological children Shiloh, 10, who was born in Namibia, plus 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, who were born in France.",

It went unmentioned that she was saying this from her $25 million two-acre hilltop estate, in a gated pocket of the Los Feliz neighborhood, a home she bought for herself and her six children in the spring, following her split from Brad Pitt.\n\nPerhaps more than any other celebrity, Ms. Jolie, 42, has kept herself firmly planted in two vastly different worlds. She\u2019s both the glamorous A-lister whose every move is tracked in headlines (\u201cAngie and the kids left Target because it didn\u2019t serve hot dogs,\u201d read one recent newsflash), and the humanitarian do-gooder who has made more than 60 trips to the field as part of her United Nations work. Apparent contradictions account for her elusive allure. Ms. Jolie has been enduringly hard to peg, a woman who cannot easily be lumped into a single category because she occupies many at once.\n\nShe is a peerless glamazon as well as the women\u2019s health advocate who told the world about her preventative double mastectomy. She has a meticulously managed public profile yet professes not to care what others think. She remains near the pinnacle of celebrity\u2019s cruel pyramid, even though her recent movies only made money when she was camouflaged (\u201cMaleficent,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d). She is obsessed over \u2014 if, in the United States at least, not exactly beloved \u2014 and fixed in the cultural firmament as America\u2019s vixen despite having a half-dozen-strong brood.\n\nAnd even though the public appetite for salacious details of her personal life has long eclipsed interest in the films she has directed, Ms. Jolie doggedly brings tough, obscure stories to the screen. Three of the four movies she has made are set in wartime, including her latest, \u201cFirst They Killed My Father,\u201d based on the true story of Loung Ung, who as a young girl survived the Cambodian genocide and is now one of Ms. Jolie\u2019s close friends.\n\nWhile Ms. Jolie\u2019s earlier movies garnered tepid reviews, several critics have anointed \u201cFirst They Killed My Father\u201d her best yet. It is told entirely from the little girl\u2019s point of view, in Khmer, and received a standing ovation at the Telluride Film Festival, where it had its premiere. Netflix was to begin streaming it on Sept. 15, when it will also open in a small number of theaters.\n\nMs. Jolie said she could not have made the movie had she not first directed \u201cIn the Land of Blood and Honey\u201d (2011) about the Bosnian war, and \u201cUnbroken\u201d (2014), based on the true story of an American G.I. taken prisoner in World War II. (She and Mr. Pitt starred together as a married couple locked in a different kind of conflict in her 2015 drama, \u201cBy the Sea\u201d).\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious plan of, I was going to make war films, it\u2019s just what I was drawn to,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Jolie has an indelible connection to Cambodia, not least because it completely reordered her life. Before first visiting in 2000 to shoot \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider,\u201d she had been a Hollywood wild child, a ravishing Goth weirdo who, at the Oscars that year, dressed like Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, and locked lips with her brother. She also got publicly hot and heavy with her second husband, Billy Bob Thornton, and wore a locket with droplets of his blood around her neck.\n\nThe grace and humility she saw in the Cambodian people, along with the lasting effects of the genocide, threw Hollywood life into unflattering relief.\n\n\u201cOnce you get exposed to what\u2019s really happening in the world, and other people\u2019s realities, you just can\u2019t ever not know, and you can\u2019t ever wake up and pretend it\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said, \u201cYour entire life shifts.\u201d\n\nShe adopted Maddox, now 16, from an orphanage, divorced Mr. Thornton, and threw herself into humanitarian and environmental work, finding lasting inspiration in wartime survivors and aid workers.\n\n\u201cThe real will to survive, and the strength of the human spirit, and the love of the human family becomes so present, and that\u2019s how we should all be living,\u201d Ms. Jolie said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re around it, it\u2019s quite contagious, and you know to learn from it.\u201d\n\nThe air pressed in hot and close as she spoke, and the sun was climbing its way toward a broiling midday. I was all but keeling over, but Ms. Jolie, who adores the heat, was as composed as a sphinx. (We soon moved to the air-conditioned climes of her kitchen.)\n\nMs. Jolie is a contained and poised presence, yet also light, breaking every now and then into lilting laughter. She is as visually arresting as she appears onscreen; the sculpted lines of her face alongside the soft O\u2019s of her eyes and mouth make hers an otherworldly beauty. Though slight as a sylph, she says she doesn\u2019t exercise, beyond dipping into the pool with her kids and vaguely intending to someday jump on a treadmill.\n\nAlthough it was still August, the children \u2014 Maddox; Pax, 13; Zahara, 12; Shiloh; Knox; and his twin, Vivienne \u2014 had already begun home school. They would be accompanying her to the Telluride and Toronto film festivals \u2014 Maddox has an executive producer credit on the film \u2014 and were making up for lost lesson time, working with tutors in various corners of the house, learning, among other things, Arabic, sign language and physics.\n\nI asked Ms. Jolie if she ever felt like the coach of a small team, and she replied that more often she felt part of a fraternity.\n\n\u201cThey really help me so much. We\u2019re really such a unit,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re the best friends I\u2019ve ever had. Nobody in my life has ever stood by me more.\u201d\n\nThat last sentence hung in the air, perhaps a subtle allusion to, or indictment of, Mr. Pitt, who adopted Maddox, Pax and Zahara, and is the biological father of Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne. The dissolution of their 12-year romantic partnership came last September, after an incident aboard a private jet \u2014 purportedly involving Mr. Pitt and Maddox \u2014 prompted her to file for divorce.\n\nShortly afterward, Ms. Jolie and the kids moved out of Mr. Pitts\u2019s estate, living in a rental for nine months as she struggled with the decision about whether to buy a new home.\n\n\u201cIt took me a few months to realize that I was really going to have to do it. That there was going to have to be another base regardless of everything,\u201d she said, her voice falling quiet and low, as it would each time the subject of the split arose. \u201cThat there was going to have to be a home. Another home.\u201d\n\nThe new house, a Beaux Arts manse that was once the residence of the legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, is a beaut, with a library, rolling lawns, cascading fountains that burble into the pool, and a view of the Griffith Observatory. Ms. Jolie had an elaborate treehouse built \u2014 \u201cmore a parkour treehouse,\u201d she said \u2014 and the kids helped decorate and pick out the furniture for the whole house. They have an agreement, Ms. Jolie said, that not everyone can agree on everything, but you have to try to like it if you don\u2019t hate it. If you do hate it, you can overrule.\n\n\u201cIt has a lot of moments,\u201d Ms. Jolie said of the home, \u201cIt\u2019s happy. Happy and light, and we needed that.\u201d\n\nI asked how everyone is doing now.\n\n\u201cNone of it\u2019s easy. It\u2019s very, very difficult, a very painful situation, and I just want my family healthy,\u201d she said quietly.\n\nAre they? \u201cThey\u2019re getting better,\u201d she said, her voice approaching inaudibility.\n\nShe intimated that \u201cFirst They Killed My Father\u201d might have informed her decision to leave Mr. Pitt. The film centers on Ms. Ung\u2019s family members, some of whom survived, and Ms. Jolie said she thought a lot about what family meant during production, and how they should help each other and take care of one another (the film is adapted from Ms. Ung\u2019s 2000 book of the same name).\n\n\u201cLoung had such horrors in her life but also had so much love, and that is why she\u2019s all right today,\u201d Ms. Jolie said. \u201cThat is something I need to remember.\u201d\n\nDetermined to make the film as Cambodian as possible, Ms. Jolie teamed with the Cambodian director Rithy Panh, who received an Oscar nomination for his 2014 documentary, \u201cThe Missing Picture,\u201d and enlisted thousands of Cambodians as extras. Ms. Jolie said Maddox was her right-hand man, working on the script, taking meeting notes and bantering with Mr. Panh in French. Some of the scenes were shot on massacre sites, so the crew arranged for monks to pray and set out incense and offerings beforehand.\n\n\u201cShe is very loved there,\u201d said Mr. Panh, who served as a producer on the film. He added that he was struck by Ms. Jolie\u2019s humility, and how she intuitively communicated with the children on set, despite her shaky grasp of the Cambodian language. (Ms. Jolie said a suggestion in Vanity Fair that children were cruelly hoodwinked in the casting process was \u201ca mischaracterization.\u201d)\n\nMs. Ung said Ms. Jolie, who has Cambodian citizenship, shares her countrymen\u2019s sensibilities. \u201cIn Cambodia you don\u2019t raise your voice, you speak kindly to people, you greet people with your hands together and bow,\u201d Ms. Ung said. \u201cAll of this comes naturally to her.\u201d\n\nAs our interview wrapped, Ms. Jolie joked that she would next work on a comedy. \u201cI will get funny at some point,\u201d she said, adding that she was working on \u201cMaleficent 2,\u201d a sequel to the Disney fractured fairy tale. \u201cThat was a little funny,\u201d she said, wryly.\n\nMs. Jolie also seemed aware of how she might be beheld by the public; the removed ice queen to Mr. Pitt\u2019s affable down-home Missouri boy (his revealing interview in the summer issue of GQ Style helped burnish his image as the more relatable one). But she grew up a punk in school, she said, and was used to not fitting in, and being someone people had opinions about.\n\n\u201cI never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,\u201d Ms. Jolie said, walking me down her driveway, \u201cAnd that\u2019s O.K., because I know who I am, and the kids know who I am.\u201d\n\nShe quickly embraced me goodbye, and I set off into the sun and the heat, as the heavy security gate slowly drew shut behind.\n",

In fact, it's George Clooney's new bride who has taken out the top spot.\n\nAmal Clooney was named #4 in\u00a0the Evening Standard's The 1000 Power List 2014 following British Prime Minister David Cameron, scientist Steven Hawkins and Prince Harry. \u00a0Other women crowned in the Top 20 were designer and UN Goodwill ambassador Victoria Beckham at #9, recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai at #12 and legendary performer Kate Bush at #16.\n\nSo what is it about Clooney that makes her so influential? She has recently become better known as the well dressed, beautiful 36 year old wife of Hollywood star George Clooney, but Amal has been making waves as a top Barrister\u00a0specialising in international law for years and describes herself as 'lawyer, activist and author.'\n\nThe British Lebanese lawyer perhaps most famously defended Julian Assange, the founder of Wiki Leaks, in his fight against extradition in Sweden earlier this year. She also represented Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister of Ukraine\u00a0before the European Court of Human Rights while the latter was detained under the rule of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Her credentials don't stop there, with Clooney having previously worked across numerous United Nations commissions, advising governments across international law.\n\nFurthermore, in May 2014 she met with British Foreign Secretary William Hague to discuss international efforts to respond to sexual violence in conflict zones.\n\nSo sought after is Clooney, that she recently had to turn down an offer from the United Nations to be one of three people on an inquiry investigating war crimes in Gaza; stating that 'I am honoured... but given existing commitments - including eight ongoing cases - unfortunately I could not accept this role.'\n\nSo how did Clooney become such an internationally renowned lawyer? She studied Jurisprudence at St. Hugh's College, Oxford where she received an Exhibition scholarship and the Shrigley award, followed by a Master of Law degree at the prestigious New York University where she gained the Jack J. Katz Memorial Award for excellence in entertainment law. Since then she has lectured students on international criminal Law in London, New York and North Carolina.\n\nHaving recently returned home to London from a trip to Athens advising the Greek government, it seems Amal Clooney has taken the world, not just London, by storm, and rightly so.\n",

    "text": "\nIn the preface of her two Reputation-themed magazines, which feature photos, poetry and hand-written lyrics to celebrate the release of her sixth album, Swift lamented the inevitable news stories that guess at the targets of her lyrics.\n\n\u201cWhen this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it\u2019s 2017 and if you didn\u2019t see a picture of it, it couldn\u2019t have happened right?\u201d\n\nYet, even with its controversy-winking title, Reputation is probably the least-gossipy release of Swift\u2019s career. Instead of an array of songs potentially referencing different ex-lovers, the majority of Reputation is dedicated to a single subject, whom Swift is still (as far as fans know) happily dating.\n\nThe allusions to Swift\u2019s past dramas are few and far between, and when they do show up on Reputation, they make for some of the album\u2019s very best songs. Swift steers clear of Katy Perry and squad drama and bashing her exes, keeping her apologies short, and list of enemies shorter.\n\nMore: Taylor Swift, pop princess, wins song of the year at the CMA Awards\n\nSwift is a master at chronicling her soured relationships, with many of her finest songs memorializing (and sometimes flaming) her exes. So what happens when Swift writes an album about a person she\u2019s still into? That\u2019s the story of Reputation, and the British actor Joe Alwyn, whom Swift has been spotted with over the past year, is the man at its center.\n\n\u201cOh, 25 years old / Oh, how were you to know,\u201d Swift sings on Dancing With Our Hands Tied, referencing Alwyn\u2019s age at the time she wrote the album (he's 26 now). The \u201cocean blue eyes\u201d Swift sings about on Gorgeous almost certainly belong to Alwyn, a motif that repeats on Dancing With Our Hands Tied (\u201cDeep blue, but you painted me golden\u201d) and Delicate (\u201cOh damn, never seen that color blue\u201d). Swift also mentions his British roots in Gorgeous when she sings, \u201cYou should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk,\u201d calling herself his \u201cAmerican queen\u201d on King Of My Heart and teasing, \u201cDo the girls back home touch you like I do?\u201d on Delicate.\n\nAnd beyond songs like Gorgeous and Delicate that deliberately reference Alwyn, Swift spends the majority of Reputation lusting after, falling in love with and eventually pledging her loyalty to her new beau, the most time she\u2019s ever spent on a romantic upswing on one of her albums.\n\nTaylor Swift and Kanye West (and her squad)\n\nSwift came out of the gate swinging\u00a0on Reputation's lead single Look What You Made Me Do, with lyrics like \"I don\u2019t like your little games / Don\u2019t like your tilted stage\" that seemed directed at West, the rapper who reignited their feud when he unceremoniously included Swift's name in his Famous lyrics.\n\nWith an album\u00a0title like Reputation, fans speculated whether the entire album would be a vindictive screed aimed at Swift's enemies. Turns out,\u00a0Look What You Made Me Do\u00a0was a red herring, and West barely makes an appearance in the album's lyrics, save for one other song in which Swift laughing at the rapper as she dances on his grave.\n\nThe album's third-to-last track,\u00a0This Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things, is a postmortem of Swift's 1989 era, when she partied with her squad members on Instagram and was buddy-buddy with West, before 2016 arrived and Swift's public persona took a hit.\n\n\"It was so nice throwing big parties / Jump into the pool from the balcony,\" Swift begins, remembering \"feeling so Gatsby for that whole year\" before she gets to the chorus, singing with a smirk in her voice, \"This is why we can\u2019t have nice things, darling / Because you break them.\"\n\nThen, it's West's turn. \"It was so nice being friends again / There I was giving you a second chance / But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand,\" she sings, referencing their fateful phone call about Famous that West's camp recorded and later posted to smear her as duplicitous.\n\n\"But I\u2019m not the only friend you\u2019ve lost lately / If only you weren\u2019t so shady,\" she continues, raising a toast to her real friends, her mother, and then eventually to West. \"And here\u2019s to you, 'cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do,\" she says, before breaking down in giggles, saying, \"I can\u2019t even say it with a straight face!\"\n\nThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things\u00a0may be an enjoyable slice of pettiness, but the album's crown jewel of gossip is Getaway Car, which sees Swift in full storyteller mode as she chronicles using one doomed relationship\u00a0to escape another.\n\nWith lyrics like\u00a0\u201cI wanted to leave him, I needed a reason\u201d and \"With three of us, honey, it\u2019s a sideshow,\" the song seems to reference the several months in 2016 when Swift parted ways with Calvin Harris and dated Tom Hiddleston immediately after, before eventually splitting with him too. To follow the song's metaphor, Hiddleston is the getaway car driver who whisks Swift away from another man (\"Well he was running after us / I was screaming \u2018Go go go!'\").\n\nIn the end, she leaves him too, escaping with the fortune and singing, \"I put the money in a bag and stole the keys / That was the last time you ever saw me.\"\n\nSwift may not want fans to linger on the gossip behind her songs, but when it's as wonderfully told as\u00a0Getaway Car, honestly, who can blame them?\n",

Klum, 42, and Seal, 53, were all smiles while they caught up with each other. Klum and Seal share three children together, Henry, 10, and Johan, 9, and daughter Lou, 6. Seal also adopted Klum's daughter Leni, 11, while they were married.\n\nBoth the supermodel and the British singer have moved on in their personal lives, as Klum has dated Vito Schnabel since 2014 and Seal has been linked to Erica Packer. Packer, who was previously married to James Packer, opened up to Australia's Today show a couple of months ago and gushed about her relationship with the \"Kissed by a Rose\" singer.\n\n\"I'm very happy,\" she said. \"It's an incredibly happy time in my life and he's a very beautiful and magical soul and I feel lucky to have met him.\"\n\nMeanwhile on the BBMAs red carpet, the Project Runway host opened up about her boyfriend to E! News' Jason Kennedy that she's \"very much in love.\"\n\n\"How do you know when it is? You just feel it, and then you know,\" Klum said of her romance with the art dealer. \"Is there something that you can pinpoint on someone? It's just a whole package that you fall in love with, right?\"\n\nUnfortunately, Schnabel couldn't attend the awards show Sunday because he was in New York, so Klum walked the red carpet solo. Earlier in the evening Seal, who presented C\u00e9line Dion with the Icon award, walked the red carpet, too.\n\nDid you watch the Billboard Music Awards?

He also appeared on ITV's Grease Is The Word.\n\nGest was due to tour the United Kingdom in a musical show called David Gest Is Not Dead, But Alive With Soul, starting in York on July 1.\n\nThe name was inspired by an incident in the Celebrity Big Brother House when American reality star Tiffany Pollard mistakenly believed Gest had died rather than David Bowie.\nFriend Imad Handi said: \"It is with great sadness that I can confirm that David Gest has died today.\n\n\"David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon.\n\nMr Handi added: \"I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners.\n\n\"If I may steal the words of one eminent critic, David was a natural star and a genuine celebrity. I will miss him desperately.\"\nGest married Minnelli in March 2002 in a star-studded ceremony with Michael Jackson as best man and Elizabeth Taylor as maid of honour.\n\nBefore filing for divorce, Gest sued Minnelli for assault, claiming that she had beaten him so badly during alcoholic rages that she caused him nerve damage and caused him to be treated in hospital for five days.\n\nMinnelli also sued Gest, claiming her estranged husband had stolen at least $2 million she earned while performing in shows he produced.\n\nThe pair ended their dispute in 2007 when their lawyers filed court papers saying they had settled their differences and agreed to get divorced without fault\n\nGest grew up with Jackson and his brothers in California, and was close friends with the family.\n\nHe was a successful producer and in 2001 his television special on the 30th anniversary of the launch of Jackson's solo career was the highest rated in history.\n\nIn a recent interview with the BBC, ahead of one of his shows in Eastbourne, he spoke frankly about not wanting to be famous while he was married to Minnelli.\n\nHe said: \"There's a part of me that never wanted to be quote 'a celebrity' when I was married - I can't remember the woman's name.\"\n\nPrompted by the interviewer that it was Minnelli, he responded: \"I knew it was Elizabeth. I never wanted to be in the public eye. It's very hard when you wake up each day and there's press outside your house.\n\n\"I would never want to live that type of life, I live a very simple life.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Gest spoke to The Grimsby Telegraph about where he wanted to be buried.\n\nHe said: \"I will never go back to LA; I will die here and want to be buried in York. I love this country much more than my own.\"\n\nCelebrities' shock at death of 'loyal dear friend'\n\nWriting on Twitter, Myleene Klass described Gest as \"wonderfully kind\" and \"extremely generous\":",

Not all of us are blessed with such youthful skin, but you can get an amazing complexion like Ellen's with these anti-aging tips from the makeup pro:\n\n\n\nYou are what you eat\n\nEllen sticks to vegan fare and practices yoga, and it's written all over her face. Boosting your intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies and cutting out processed foods helps give you that luminous look.\n\n\n\nCleanse carefully\n\nFace washes that lather up contain sulfates, which can dry your skin and make fine lines and wrinkles look worse. Instead, go for a cleansing cream that doesn't suds; it will leave skin soft and get rid of makeup and grime.\n\n\n\nQuench thirsty skin\n\nIf you're super dry, consider using a face oil at bedtime. These hydrating serums give your skin an extra plumpness and dewiness. Smooth on after cleansing and top with your night cream.\n\n\n\nGive powder makeup the brush off\n\nPowders can sink into lines, so switch to cream-based blushes, shadows, concealers and foundations. As you age, your skin loses radiance, so give it a boost with sheer, hydrating formulas that contain light reflecting particles.\n\n\n\nGo easy on the eyes\n\nLots of eye makeup can attract attention to crows feet. Use neutral shadows and a dab of smudgey liner instead of attempting a come-hither smoky eye or garish colors.\n\n\n\nChoose the right lip look\n\nTons of super shiny lip gloss can make you look like a teenager, while dark matte lipsticks can make lip lines look more prominent. Go for something in between; I recommend a hydrating sheer lipstick one shade darker than your lip tone.\n",

You\u2019re forgiven for not knowing. After all, IHOP was centuries ago, or at least 2010, when Barack Obama was a first-term president and America watched American Idol and Survivor . Here\u2019s a comprehensive guide to their on-and-off, up-and-down, are-they-or-aren\u2019t-they relationship.\n\nTMZ breaks the news that the teen idols enjoyed a \u201ccuddly\u201d date at an IHOP in Philadelphia ahead of a Q102\u2019s Jingle Ball. Gomez tells Us Weekly that it was platonic, and that Bieber is \u201cone of my best friends . . . It was just pancakes!\u201d\n\nBieber, too, stays mum on the subject, telling MTV that she\u2019s \u201can amazing person,\u201d but, \u201cI think that people are always gonna be interested in my personal life . . . but I gotta keep some things to myself. I\u2019m just having fun being a teenager.\u201d\n\nWith dating rumors swirling, paparazzi pictures catch the then 16- and 18-year-olds kissing on a yacht in St. Lucia, essentially proving what fans already suspected\u2014they\u2019re an item.\n\nAt the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, the teen-dream couple made their red carpet debut together , thereby confirming their relationship. They even take some lovey-dovey pictures in the photo booth.\n\nMay 2011\u2014Young and (Visibly) in Love\n\nAfter a glamorous appearance at the Billboard Music Awards , Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez jet off to Maui, Hawaii. Photographers catch them canoodling in the ocean \u2013Gomez noticeably rocking some statement hoops\u2014and the photos go viral.\n\nHere we reach peak Jelena\u2014 reports surface that Bieber rented the entire Staples Center arena so he and his lady love could watch Titanic , alone. \u201cRomance isn\u2019t dead,\u201d Bieber tweeted. \u201cTreat your lady right fellas.\u201d\n\nA storm brews in paradise as a woman accuses Bieber of fathering her child . After a paternity test, the case is thrown out.\n\nFor the next 10 months, all seems content on the Jelena front. They\u2019re spotted at a Lakers game, on a helicopter ride, at the Teen Choice Awards, and celebrating her birthday. But some tabloid sites start alleging that the two may not be as solid as people think.\n\nBieber and Gomez break up for the first time. Conflicting schedules, trust issues, and their young ages are all rumored to be causes of the demise.\n\nAlthough the two aren\u2019t together, and despite the fact that Gomez tells Ryan Seacrest \u201cit\u2019s not really about a specific person,\u201d fans theorize that her new song \u201cCome & Get It,\u201d with lyrics like \u201cCan\u2019t stop because I love it, hate the way I love you / All day all night, maybe I\u2019m addicted for life, no lie,\u201d is about Bieber.\n\nFuel is added to the fire when Bieber allegedly posts\u2014and then quickly deletes\u2014 an Instagram with Gomez.\n\nBut at the end of 2013, Bieber admits the two aren\u2019t speaking , although he still loves her.\n\n2014\u2014Are They or Aren\u2019t They?\n\n2014, to put it lightly, was a confusing year in the Jelena timeline . First of all, it\u2019s the year that Bieber\u2019s image goes full-on bad boy\u2014after bizarre incidents in 2013, like peeing in a bucket and losing custody of his monkey\u2014he gets in real, tangible trouble. In January alone, he\u2019s arrested for drunk driving, resisting arrest, and driving without a valid license, and he was also accused of vandalism for egging his neighbors. (January isn\u2019t great for Gomez, either, who checks into rehab .) The tabloids viciously suggest it\u2019s because of Bieber and/or a drug problem, but a frustrated Gomez later tells GQ that it was to seek help for lupus.\n\nBut before the rehab and before the DUI, the couple is spotted riding Segways in Calabasas, California . Throughout the year, and all the drama, the \u201cmaybe dates\u201d continue: a Starbucks run in Texas and a day at the zoo. Then, the Instagram\u2014Bieber posts (and also deletes) a bunch of pictures of his former beau, including one that calls their love \u201cunconditional.\u201d\n\nBut concurrently woven in those sightings are other ones . . . with Bieber and other women. He\u2019s associated with a slew of models, up-and-coming actresses, and other beauties\u2014including Kendall and Kylie Jenner, who Gomez at one point reportedly unfollows on Instagram , and she also unfollowed Bieber.\n\nThen there\u2019s the international incident in July 2014, when Orlando Bloom and Justin Bieber get into fist fight , allegedly over Gomez.\n\nIn November, Gomez releases \u201cThe Heart Wants What It Wants,\u201d which she suggests is about Bieber. She gives an emotional performance of the song at the American Music Awards, which some signal to mean the relationship has finally run its course. That same month, Bieber unfollows her on Instagram . In December, he posts a picture of himself with Hailey Baldwin, but in the caption says he\u2019s \u201csuper single.\u201d\n\n2015\u2014Are They or Aren\u2019t They? (Part Two)\n\nWe\u2019re entering the second of the lost Jelena years, where no one knows quite what\u2019s going on, perhaps not even the Bieber and Gomez themselves.\n\nAfter being spotted holding hands at a Golden Globes party, Gomez and Zedd enjoy a brief romance. Zedd admits two years later to Billboard that he wasn\u2019t ready to date an international superstar like Gomez: \u201cReporters were calling my parents. People were hacking my friends\u2019 phones. I was pissed. [Though] I kind of knew what I was getting myself into,\u201d he said.\n\nBieber continues to post throwback pictures of Gomez on Instagram, confusing just about everyone\u2014 including Drake . Reconciliation rumors ramp up after he tells Ellen DeGeneres that a number of songs on his new album Purpose are about Gomez, and a video surfaces of Bieber serenading her with \u201cMy Girl\u201d at a hotel in Beverly Hills.\n\nBut Gomez makes it clear she\u2019s sick of being defined by their relationship. In her cover story with Elle , she says her November 2014 AMA performance was her personal life swan song. \u201cEverybody was talking about the same thing: my relationship,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI was so exhausted. I said, \u2018I want this [performance] to be the last time I have to talk about this. And acknowledge this feeling.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEarly 2016\u2014Here We Go Again\n\nIn January 2016, Justin Bieber posts steamy pictures with Hailey Baldwin in St. Barth\u2019s , which many take to mean they are dating. The speculation increases when Baldwin makes a cameo in Bieber\u2019s GQ cover story. He describes her as \u201csomeone I really love. We spend a lot of time together.\u201d\n\nHowever, Baldwin later tells Marie Claire that they weren\u2019t ever official. \u201cWe are not an exclusive couple. He\u2019s about to go on tour,\u201d she said. \u201cRelationships at this age are already complicated, but I don\u2019t really like to talk about it because it\u2019s between me and him.\u201d\n\nBieber posts a throwback picture of him and Gomez kissing, and she comments \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nAlthough claiming they\u2019re just friends , Bieber posts a series of Instagrams with Sofia Richie. However, after backlash from fans, Bieber posted \u201cI\u2019m gonna make my Instagram private if you guys don\u2019t stop the hate this is getting out of hand, if you guys are really fans you wouldn\u2019t be so mean to people that I like.\u201d\n\nGomez responded in the comments section: \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol\u2014it should be special between you two only. Don\u2019t be mad at your fans. They love you.\u201d\n\nThat, allegedly, kicked off a full-on Instagram war between the couple, involving many comments, including cheating accusations on both sides, which are now said to be deleted. Gomez later takes to her Snapchat to say that what she did was \u201cselfish and pointless.\u201d Bieber deletes his Instagram.\n\nA few months later, it's reported that Gomez cut her Revival Tour short to seek treatment at a facility in Tennessee. \u201cMy self-esteem was shot. I was depressed, anxious. I started to have panic attacks right before getting onstage, or right after leaving the stage. Basically I felt I wasn\u2019t good enough, wasn\u2019t capable,\u201d she later told Vogue.\n\nGomez and The Weeknd hit the red carpet couple together at the 2017 Met Gala.\n\nGomez reveals on Instagram that she underwent a kidney transplant. (The donor was her friend Francia Raisa.)\n\nBieber and Gomez are seen hanging out together again , but multiple sources say it\u2019s just as friends. Allegedly, their church, Hillsong, as well as Gomez\u2019s kidney transplant caused to two to reconnect. And The Weeknd was reportedly fine with it.\n\nHowever, just about a week after the reports, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd announce their split (although, apparently, Bieber was not the cause).\n\nIn the weeks following Gomez\u2019s breakup with The Weeknd, she's spotted canoodling with Bieber. . . again and again and again. On November 15, they kiss at his hockey game\u2014fueling tabloid speculation that they are back together and better than ever.\n\nMaybe, or maybe not. Because if this timeline has taught you anything, dear reader, it should be that at this point, the truth is anybody\u2019s guess.\n",

    "text": "\nRobert Pattinson is earning rave reviews for his intense and electrifying performance in A24\u2019s crime thriller, \u201cGood Time.\u201d Under the helm of directors and brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, the \u201cTwilight\u201d star hides his dashing good looks to portray a grimy, bleached blond, goatee-sporting, crook from Queens, New York, who embarks on a mission to bail his mentally impaired brother (played by co-director Benny) out of prison after a failed robbery attempt. While taking on the demanding role, Pattinson said the experience has helped him mature into a commanding actor.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m more confident now; this was a challenging role and I learned a lot about my abilities as an actor,\u201d Pattinson told Variety at the film\u2019s New York premiere on Tuesday evening, held at the School of Visual Arts Theatre. \u201cEvery single time I get to do another movie, I get a little more confident. You always want to grow in some way and challenge yourself. I feel like this one has helped me become a better actor.\u201d\n\nCritics have no doubt that Pattinson has developed into a masterful dramatic actor. He and the \u201cGood Time\u201d creators received a rousing six-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival last May where the movie first screened for an audience. The picture \u2014 out in theaters on Friday \u2014 currently holds a 94% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nRobert Pattinson on Shedding His Movie Star Looks for Cannes Drama \u2018Good Time\u2019\n\n\u201cThe writing in this \u2014 the dialogue felt so real and different,\u201d explained the 31-year-old British star on the red carpet. \u201cIt\u2019s set in New York and I\u2019ve been here in New York a million times, but it just felt alien to me. There was something different and original about the characters and the story. I immediately knew the world of the performance that I wanted to do and I knew the energy I wanted when I saw Josh and Benny\u2019s work. This was special.\u201d\n\nNow that Pattinson has received acclaim for his work in indie films and broken any preconceptions about his acting abilities, would he consider taking on another role in a tentpole franchise series like \u201cTwilight\u201d or stick to art house films?\n\n\u201cI look across the board every day,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cThe only thing I do is read script after script waiting for something to hit me. I like stories that feel authentic and it\u2019s just difficult to find. There are a lot of scripts that feel like the writer read a newspaper article and then tried to use their knowledge from film schools to adapt it. That doesn\u2019t interest me. Once I find something and feel really obsessed with it, I feel like I can really connect with the character and bring them to life.\u201d\n\nAfter the screening, Pattinson joined the film\u2019s directors, producers, co-star Barkhad Abdi (\u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d), and composer Daniel Lopatin at the Flash Factory nightclub for the after-party. Guests enjoyed celebratory drinks and White Castle burgers, which are featured in the film. Demi Moore, Chloe Sevigny, and Peter Sarsgaard\u00a0were\u00a0among the guests that joined in the festivities.\n",

    "text": "\nIf you have been worried about Ben Affleck\u2019s place in the DC Extended Universe, then you can breathe a sigh of relief. Over the last few months, fans of the actor\u2019s take on the Gotham vigilante have grow increasingly worried about whether Affleck would return to the role. A series of blips concerning Batman\u2019s impending standalone movie were enough to make the most confident of fans second-guess Affleck\u2019s longterm commitment to Batfleck. In fact, some were even worried the actor would back out of The Batman entirely after Affleck stepped down as director.\n\nBut, if one inside scoop has anything to say, then Affleck is still down to reprise Bruce Wayne for the solo venture.\n\nEarlier today, noted DC Comics insider Umberto Gonzalez dropped some Batman scoop in an episode of Heroic Insider. It was there the reporter said Affleck has started a new training regiment to get him ready for The Batman. \u201cBen Affleck, Batman, I just got word that he just started training again for the role. You know how there was talk that he was gonna leave and he might leave the role? Nah, bro. He\u2019s working out. He\u2019s getting back in shape,\u201d Gonzalez told fans.\n\nOf course, there is no official confirmation about whether Affleck\u2019s new workout schedule adheres to such a promise. Still, it seems more and more likely that Affleck will return to the superhero role. Excitement for Justice League continues to mount ahead of its fall premiere this year, and the introduce of Matt Reeves to The Batman has fans fired up as well. In a recent interview with Daily News, the director admitted he\u2019s been a Batman fanboy for years, and Reeves seems partial to Affleck\u2019s darker take on the character.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing to be involved in the two franchises which were the two that I was connected to most as a child,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cI just was obsessed with Batman when I was a kid. What I find so interesting about him as a character is that, as far a superhero goes, he\u2019s not superhuman, he is a person. And he is a tortured soul who is grappling with his past and trying to find a way to be in a world that has a lot that\u2019s wrong with it and trying to find a way to reconcile all of that.\u201d In Justice League, fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman\u2019s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes\u2014Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash\u2014it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.\n\n Justice League is directed by Zack Snyder, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio, based on a story by Snyder and Terrio, and stars Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Amy Adams, Willem Dafoe, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J. K. Simmons, and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds.\n",

You\u2019re off the hook and you don\u2019t have to worry about what\u2019s coming. \u2018Okay, the world freaking ended. That\u2019s great. Now what?'\u201d\n\n\u201cGive up! Surrender to the idea that things are bad and yet still, from 3,000 feet up, we don\u2019t matter,\u201d he continued. \u201cThings are happening and we\u2019re going to happen along with them whether we like it or not. But we don\u2019t matter. \u2026 Once you lose yourself, you\u2019re pretty okay. Just get you out of the way.\u201d\n\nWhile Carrey\u2019s advice was sparked by Moore\u2019s questions about the Trump presidency, the Truman Show star said his\u00a0philosophy was born out of pain he\u2019s gone through in the past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all so afraid of the river of tears,\u201d Carrey said, explaining that he, like many, had avoided his problems in the past with \u201cfood and sex and noise and gadgets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is, going down the river of sorrow and suffering is the way to freedom,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve gone through it and I\u2019m telling you, you don\u2019t survive it. You don\u2019t come out of it on the other side. You might come out of it with a body, but there\u2019s no you attached to it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be yourself if you don\u2019t have a self.\u201d\n\nCarrey has been open about struggling with depression since his youth. The past few years have been difficult ones: In 2015, his on-and-off girlfriend\u00a0Cathriona White\u00a0 died by suicide.\u00a0Since then he\u2019s been involved in legal battles with her family over\u00a0wrongful death\u00a0allegations, which he denies.\n\nCarrey told Moore that choosing what part he wants to play in life has helped him move forward.\n\n\u201cKnow that no matter what happens, this is not who you are,\u201d Carrey said. \u201cYou choose the part you want to play in this life. I want to be a good guy. I want to do good things. I want to make people happy and I want to help out when I can. So you do what you need to do.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in his chat with Moore \u2014 which came towards the end of the the Oscar-winning director\u2019s impassioned two-and-a-half hour one-man show \u2014 Carrey laid into President Trump, claiming the 71-year-old former\u00a0Celebrity Apprentice\u00a0host deceived working-class voters into thinking he wasn\u2019t a member of the \u201celite\u201d group he had so aggressively attacked during his campaign.\n\n\u201cThey say that the best trick the devil ever did was convincing people that he didn\u2019t exist, but I think the best trick was convincing 40 percent of this country that this truffle pig who spends half of his presidency gargling caviar behind the wheel of a golf cart isn\u2019t the elite,\u201d Carrey said. \u201cHe has a golden f\u2014\u2014 apartment. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does he do that with a baseball cap?\u201d Carrey asked. \u201cI used to think Clark Kent\u2019s disguise was flimsy. \u2018Dude you\u2019re Superman, you\u2019re busting out of the suit, it\u2019s obvious!\u2019 Trump makes that look intricate.\u201d\n\nCarrey also criticized what he called \u201ca war on intelligence and discernment in this country,\u201d saying that people are \u201cmade to feel guilty for being smart.\u201d\n\nCarrey said that he hopes both Trump supporters and critics find a way to understand one another moving forward \u2014 as \u201cevery person is to be cared about and thought of as precious, including the people that don\u2019t agree with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this trend of, \u2018If you don\u2019t agree with me, it\u2019s hatred,\u2019 \u201d Carrey said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t agree with someone, you don\u2019t agree with them. It doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s hatred. And we have to get back to that and have discourse. We can disagree with each other.\u201d\n\n",

It started when Beyonc\u00e9 attended President Obama\u2019s inauguration with her husband, Jay-Z, in 2008, and later serenaded the new first couple with a rendition of Etta James\u2019s \u201cAt Last.\u201d Over the years, the two continued to grow closer, collaborating on several causes (including the First Lady\u2019s Let\u2019s Move campaign against childhood obesity), and even bringing their families together at Camp David. And while we knew these two powerhouses were friends, it was hard to picture them just casually hanging out together (their schedules alone must have made it close to impossible). Thankfully, this morning, fan group the Beehive released a short clip on Twitter showing Obama, Beyonc\u00e9, and Solange doing just that at the superstar\u2019s birthday party last year. Who knew a video of Bey and Michelle saying \u201cBye, Felicia\u201d could be so satisfying?\n",

    "text": "\nGet ready for one of the hottest movie couples ever... and it's a pretty unexpected one, too! TV heartthrob Milo Ventimiglia just signed on to Jennifer Lopez's upcoming romantic comedy, Second Act, and it sounds like we're going to see some sparks fly between them. Milo Ventimiglia will play J. Lo's boyfriend in the new movie, according to Variety, and the casting news has fans of the two stars shook.\n\nMilo Ventimiglia will be playing the longtime boyfriend of Jennifer Lopez's character in Second Act, which is slated to come out next year. We don't know much about Ventimiglia's character yet, but the movie will be about Lopez's character reinventing her life, starting out as a Costco employee who uses her street smarts to make it big on Madison Avenue. Leah Remini will play the best friend of Lopez's character, and Vanessa Hudgens is also attached to play an executive at a consumer goods company. Other cast members include Freddie Stroma (UnREAL, Harry Potter), Dan Bucatinsky (Scandal), and Annaleigh Ashford (Masters of Sex).\n\nThis will be the first time Milo Ventimiglia and Jennifer Lopez have ever worked together on a project, which makes it all the more exciting for fans to see these super buzzy stars team up and play boyfriend and girlfriend on-screen. Just call them J-Milo. Or Mi-Lo. Maybe just Milo & J. Lo? I know there's a good couple name in there somewhere!\n\nAlthough they've never worked together, Milo Ventimiglia and Jennifer Lopez actually have gotten to know one another better over the past year after both stars began helming their respective NBC series \u2014 Ventimiglia stars as the deceased father Jack Pearson on This Is Us and Lopez stars as police officer Harlee Santos on Shades of Blue. The two were photographed together at an NBC event back in March, and Lopez has even come out as a massive fan of Ventimiglia's show This Is Us. A couple months ago, she and her boyfriend Alex Rodriguez recreated a scene from the show in which Milo's character Jack did push-ups with his son Randall. Earlier this month, Milo's co-star Chrissy Metz said she was so surprised when she learned Jennifer Lopez was a major fan of the series.\n\nIt's safe to say J. Lo isn't the only massive Milo Ventimiglia fan out there. Twitter erupted in excitement after new of the casting broke on Wednesday afternoon. Check out some of the best responses below:\n\nAlthough, I guess if you're a hardcore This Is Us fan, it may be hard to see Jack Pearson making out with J. Lo and not Rebecca (Mandy Moore). Second Act will be Milo Ventimiglia's first major motion picture in the romantic comedy genre since reemerging to TV fame in This Is Us. He first came to fame as another romantic lead: the small-town bad boy Jess Mariano in Gilmore Girls. His other major TV role between those two was as the paramedic-turned-superhero Peter Petrelli in the NBC drama Heroes.\n\nJennifer Lopez is best known for being the international pop star behind some of the biggest Top 40 songs of the 2000s, but she's also cultivated a respected career as an actress thanks to movies like Selena, Out Of Sight, and Maid in Manhattan. She currently stars in the crime drama Shades of Blue, and will star in NBC's next live musical: Bye Bye Birdie Live!\n\nThe news of Milo Ventimiglia and Jennifer Lopez playing boyfriend and girlfriend is exciting, but unfortunately fans are going to have to wait a while before they can see the on-screen couple together. Second Act is set to come out sometime in 2018, and since it sounds like they're just beginning the filming process now, it probably won't be until towards the end of the year.\n",

    "text": "\nHe made his name as teenage vampire heart-throb Edward Cullen in Twilight. Then his turbulent romance with co\u2011star Kristen Stewart dominated the world's gossip columns. Now Robert Pattinson is older, wiser and shedding his Hollywood pretty-boy image. He talks about his new role in David Mich\u00f4d's dystopian outback western The Rover \n\nThere is a moment in The Rover, David Mich\u00f4d's futuristic western set in the Australian outback, in which Robert Pattinson's character sits in the cab of a truck at night listening to the radio play Keri Hilson's hit Pretty Girl Rock. The night is black and the radio tinny, and softly Pattinson begins to sing along. \"Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful,\" he sings, his voice high and whiny, the lyrics muffled by lips that cling to dirty teeth. \"Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful.\"\n\nIt's a pivotal moment for Rey, the slow, needy, uncertain young man Pattinson plays, but it also feels like something of a reference point in the career of the actor himself; a small reminder for the audience of just how far he has run from his days as the pretty-boy Hollywood pin-up.\n\nThe Pattinson who walks into our interview this morning seems to play a similar trick, pointing out, two steps into the room, that the hotel carpet \"looks like a Magic Eye picture\". And indeed it does \u2013 a bold, blurry pattern in stripes of cream and black. But Pattinson's remark also serves to shifts attention neatly away from himself, as if he is weary of being the centre of it, the face that everyone stares at.\n\nPattinson was 22 when he was first cast as Edward Cullen in the Twilight Saga, the five-part movie adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's best-selling teen vampire novels. Overnight he became one of Hollywood's most adored young stars, pursued wherever he went by paparazzi and screaming fans. He was named \"the most handsome man in the world\" by Vanity Fair, and one of the 100 Most Influential People by Time. Amid all the fuss and the madness he embarked upon a tortuous relationship with his co-star, Kristen Stewart, that meant the young couple were rarely out of the gossip pages.\n\nHe is 28 now. The final Twilight instalment done, the Stewart romance finished, he is finally cutting a dash as a serious actor.\n\nEarly leading-man roles (Remember Me; Water for Elephants) have given way to more challenging characters \u2013 he earned impressive reviews for his portrayal of a young billionaire in David Cronenberg's adaptation of Don DeLillo's Cosmopolis, and will soon be seen in another Cronenberg project, Maps to the Stars \u2013 as well as starring alongside Nicole Kidman in the Gertrude Bell biopic Queen of the Desert.\n\nBut for now he is rooted in Mich\u00f4d's The Rover, a brilliantly dark story of a loner (Guy Pearce) in pursuit of a gang of ramshackle crooks who have stolen his car. En route, he acquires Rey (Pattinson), the brother of one of the thieves, whom they had left for dead at the scene of a botched robbery, and together they chug through the Australian desert, now a glowering, lawless land 10 years after a global economic collapse.\n\n\"I just thought it was strikingly original,\" Pattinson says of first reading Mich\u00f4d's script. \"Even in the way it looked on the page.\n\n\"David's got a very specific way of writing dialogue. It's very functional, the writing's very harsh, it's savage, but it didn't feel just stylised writing \u2013 it was emotional as well. It just seemed so natural compared to something like No Country for Old Men. I always felt that was more like film writing. And this didn't really feel like a film script \u2013 it felt like a dream.\"\n\nPattinson has a very particular way of speaking: he will talk softly, intently about subjects you sense mean a great deal to him \u2013 Mich\u00f4d's writing, for instance, or the craft of acting \u2013 only to then sweep it to one side with a flourishing \"It was crazy!\" or a burst of wheezy, slightly wild laughter. It gives the impression of someone who has not quite yet settled into his skin.\n\nHe had to audition for The Rover \u2013 a process he loathes. \"I'm quite good at doing meetings,\" he says. \"If I'm just meeting someone about a job I'm like a dog, especially if my agent's said to me: 'A lot of people want this job.' Then I'm like: 'Oh yeah? Then I will do anything to get it!'\" What's his technique? \"I don't know, I just become a bullshit artist!\" he laughs. \"That's when I start acting! I'm really much better at doing it when the cameras aren't rolling ...\"\n\nBut auditions petrify him. He has spoken of the good 45 minutes of \"neuroses\" he has to suffer before any audition can ever really begin. \"I just can't ... I literally can't do it,\" he tries to explain. \"It's just me looking uncomfortable, trying to put on an American accent ... or sitting in the corner, making myself throw up and punching myself in the face.\" What helps get him past the neuroses, what happens after those excruciating 45 minutes that helps him perform. \"Just that you think that someone actually believes you can do something,\" he says. \"That makes me sound like such an idiot. It's crazy.\"\n\nBut the joys of acting still outweigh these moments.\n\n\"For whatever reason, I think there's something profoundly satisfying about being able to watch something you've done afterwards, or to just do a scene and feel like: 'Oh, I just had an out-of-body experience for a second!'\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Just for one second,\" he says gently. \"And generally people don't even notice. It feels literally like you've been asleep for a second.\" He recalls such a moment while shooting this film. \"It's not the biggest scene, it's not even in the movie, it was the rehearsal. And me and Guy had just been going so nuts \u2013 we'd been out in the desert and we'd become like crazy homeless people. And I turned around and looked at him and just realised actually, we're not acting any more.\" He laughs. \"And why did that feel so good? It's so weird.\"\n\nIt's easy to assume that being tethered to the long-running Twilight Saga held him back from experiencing such moments, from growing as an actor, but he argues that the role required more resources than most. \"I think Twilight's probably the hardest part I've done,\" he says, \"because to do it for five movies, it's really hard to think of stuff that's maybe not boring. Especially if you don't die. Because what's the drama? You're not scared of anything! And that's the whole essence of drama: life and death.\"\n\nPattinson was born and raised in London, but many of his film roles have required an US accent. In The Rover, Rey is from the American South, and like many has relocated to Australia in search of work in the mines. It was the voice, he says, that led him into the character.\n\nHe recalls \"losing my mind\" during his first day on set. \"It just didn't feel right for ages,\" he says. \"And then there was this one little thing \u2013 I had this makeup on my teeth, and it kept rubbing off all the time. It was really putting me off \u2013 it meant I had to keep redoing scenes. So I started trying to do this thing where I covered my teeth with my lips. And it changes your voice a little bit, but I thought: 'Oh, that's really cool!' And after that I started speaking like that 'ouhhggghhh ...'\" he replicates the style, and then laughs. \"It's so silly, it's so stupid! I was just kind of making the accent up, I don't even know what state it is really.\"\n\nBut for Pattinson, having the opportunity to play a grubby-toothed mumbler from an unidentified corner of the American South proved liberating, as did the fact that his character plays second fiddle to that of Pearce. \"There's something about Rey, and there's something about not having to drive the story forward,\" he explains. \"You can just be the condiment. It's really kind of freeing just being the sidekick weirdo.\"\n\nHe is full of praise for Pearce, for his physicality and his ability to transform himself for the role. He speaks of how, for much of their time on set, he thought Pearce to be physically bigger, and of his strange surprise when filming ended to find him not only clean-shaven but also somehow reduced in stature.\n\n\"And I liked seeing that Guy, even after having done tons and tons of movies is still scared,\" he adds. \"I've worked with some actors who, having done so many movies, they just know what they're gonna do. No matter what I would be doing in a scene they would have practised their part in a mirror already and that was it, whereas Guy is really trying to find it still. So that was why it was more fun \u2013 because neither of us really knew what the movie was about when we started. But he's not afraid to let it happen. And there's very few actors who've been doing it as long as he has that still approach it like that, that still have that element of danger.\"\n\nHow did they find out what the movie was about? \"I think it's about the feel,\" Pattinson says. \"I think after I did Cosmopolis I realised that trying to psychoanalyse parts and trying to be all clever about it ... well, it only really started with actors in the 50s, and for thousands of years before that it was just about voice and using your body as a performance instrument ...\" he gives a faintly embarrassed laugh. \"So I generally think whatever feels nice, it's probably right.\"\n\nWhat felt nice in this role was the language, he says. \"It was all the little speech patterns. It was like a song - if you're singing a song in a certain way you're not trying to make it sound sad or something, it just is.\" He frowns. \"I keep trying to do that in movies, but it's really difficult trying to find scripts that allow for it, that mean you don't have to hit specific thematic beats.\"\n\nOccasionally he tries to write something himself. \"I was trying to write a play the other day and I showed it to my assistant and didn't quite realise how bad it was.\" He laughs and laughs. \"I was writing it totally by myself in the middle of the night thinking: 'This is how you do it! You just stay up all night and keep writing!' She came in the next morning, and I'd been up all night writing. I said to her: 'You have to read this! It's amazing!'\" He could tell it was perhaps not, he says, from her facial expressions as she read. \"And then she said: 'It's not in English ... and half the time you haven't even put the character names in so it's just a stream of consciousness ...'\"\n\nBut he would like to be in a play, he says. \"Something in a really small theatre. I don't think I could do something on Broadway ... But I'd quite like to do something kind of shocking.\"\n\nHe likes being shocking, he says, and his next role is satisfyingly so. Starring alongside Robert De Niro in Olivier Assayas's Idol's Eye, he will play a small-time criminal caught up with the Chicago mafia. \"My character is this slightly delusional lost child,\" he says. \"Everyone always glamorises criminals \u2013 it feels inevitable in movies \u2013 but in this it's really not glamorised. It is quite dense. It's really serious. Very political.\"\n\nI think of something he told me earlier, about the ways in which he believes Twilight has influenced his career, and of how he wagers that most cinema audiences have judged him before he has uttered a single line on the screen. I pictured his frustration, the effort of forever trying to shake off that famous role, but on the contrary, he explained, he enjoys the possibilities that tension brings.\n\n\"It's kind of fun,\" he said. \"Because people have preconceived ideas about you, and sometimes it affords you the opportunity to shock people more.\"\n",

She\u2019s working, so otherwise, she\u2019d be here,\u2019 Colin told Entertainment Tonight on the Emmys red carpet. \u2018She\u2019s pretty cool\u2026It\u2019s hard to have a lot of complaints, she\u2019s pretty awesome.\u2019\n\nJost explained that they met on the set of SNL.\n\n\u2018The first time she hosted was the first year I was a writer on the show,\u2019 Colin said. \u2018So we\u2019ve kind of known each other since then\u2026she\u2019s the best. I\u2019m very happy, I\u2019m very lucky.\u2019\n\nSNL was nominated for a slew of cast performance awards, plus Outstanding Variety Show (which they won) and Outstanding Writing for a Variety Show, which is why Jost was in attendance.\n\nAccording to People.com Jost and Johansson were first linked back in May when they were spotted kissing at SNL\u2018s season finale afterparty.\n\nJohansson separated from her now ex-husband Romain Dauriac last summer after two years of marriage. Jost was most notably linked with actress Rashida Jones (the internet seems to be a bit murky on this relationship but suspects it was sometime around 2013).\n\nBest wishes to Jost and Johansson \u2014 hopefully they make it work!\n",

In an interview with Page Six \u2014 which, aside, has a terrible and patronizing headline \u2014 Dr. Ourian shared, \"I recommend that women stop getting lip fillers as soon as they learn they are pregnant. No one knows the implications of lip fillers on pregnant patients since dermal fillers haven\u2019t been tested on pregnant women.\"\n\nHe added, \"I would never knowingly administer lip injections to a pregnant patient. In fact, it is my policy not to perform any procedures at all on pregnant women.\"\n\nDr. Ourian also cautioned, \"If a woman receives lip fillers before becoming pregnant, the results can last several months into her pregnancy, especially if she received one of the newer longer-lasting fillers. Additionally, many women experience naturally increased lip size during pregnancy due to increased levels of estrogen, blood flow, fluids, and swelling caused by pregnancy, regardless of whether they ever received lip fillers previously.\"\n\nKylie, for her part, has remained mum on whether she's becoming a mom. Her latest social media posts do have to do with her pout though \u2014 namely, her new Kylie Cosmetics fall Lip Kits, which are also getting an accompanying purple eyeshadow palette: \"Welcome #ThePurplePalette to the @kyliecosmetics family This beauty launches next week 10.6.17 at 3pm pst only on KylieCosmetics.com!\"\n",

    "text": "\nFor more than four years, rumors have surrounded Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx, and their apparent under-the-radar romance. For a pair of very famous people they\u2019ve managed to avoid the cameras for ages, though in the last year they seemed to be making less of an effort to hide, even spotted in May boarding a private plane in Paris, where Foxx was filming Robin Hood. At the same time, tabloids claimed that the two were \u201cready to go public.\u201d\n\nAnd now, perhaps, that glorious time has come. A photograph on the Daily Mail captures the two holding hands on the beach in Malibu\u2014not exactly walking a red carpet together or making it Instagram-official, but the only public display of affection ever witnessed from these two in the wild.\n\nThe two have been rumored to take Secret Service-level precautions in their relationship; they reportedly took secret back elevators and cars with tinted windows on dates that seemed more like undercover missions. But in mid-April, a source told Us Weekly that Holmes, who has largely kept her life with her 11-year-old daughter, Suri Cruise, private, no longer wanted to play \u201cthe hiding game\u201d that she and Foxx had mastered since they were first seen together in the late summer of 2013.\n\nFive years since her divorce from Tom Cruise, Holmes remains a frequent tabloid subject, though her and Foxx\u2019s efforts and secrecy have paid off; most headlines focus on her relationship with daughter Suri, or maybe her fashion choices, rather than any romance rumors. In February, just before she and Foxx began to tease out their public relationship, Holmes told Town & Country that, regardless of what gets printed, she and Suri aren\u2019t paying attention anyway.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world a lot of celebrities probably shield their children from the tabloids; in my household we know what they print isn\u2019t true, so we don\u2019t pay attention.\u201d\n",

    "text": "\nThis morning, One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne dropped Stripped Down, his debut single, which can best be described as something that certainly exists.\n\nThat is, unfortunately, the nicest thing there is to say about the track \u2013 particularly when compared to the solo work of Payne\u2019s contemporaries Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson. Over the past year, the four seemed to have called dibs on certain sounds and musical influences, leaving Liam to try and marry the worlds of Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber, to no avail.\n\nBut we\u2019ll get to that in a second.\n\nHere\u2019s who it seems the boys of 1D are modelling themselves after. Whether they\u2019re succeeding is another thing entirely.\n\nSince he quit the band long before the boys called a hiatus, it\u2019s not surprising that the singer\u2019s debut (Mind of Mine, released in March 2016) seemed to dramatically strive to establish itself as the musical antithesis of One Direction. Between interviews that saw Zayn slagging off the band and his aesthetic rebrand that saw him secure a collaboration with Donatella Versace, Malik seemed keen to distance himself from the artist he used to be in the most dramatic sense.\n\nWhich explains why he took the Abel Tesfaye road of singing about sex, drugs, and a combination of the two. But where the Weeknd took years to earn mainstream recognition (and worked his way through the industry), Zayn\u2019s fanbase was already built in \u2013 which is why his rejection of One Direction seemed particularly harsh. So while Malik is a smart, talented, and multi-dimensional person, his debut lacked the authenticity that defines his fellow R&B artists. Not that he can\u2019t come back from that: having spent the past year opening up about his anxiety and keeping his head down, he could emerge for his sophomore effort as a grown-ass man, aware that the best artists are the sum of all parts \u2013 boy bands and all.\n\nWith Harry, it\u2019s a toss-up between Bowie and Jagger and even Robbie Williams \u2013 particularly when you consider the sweeping nature of Styles\u2019 first single, Sign of the Times. (Enter: Millennium.) But thanks to tracks including Carolina, Woman, and even Kiwi, the future Dunkirk star seems to have modelled his full-length debut after the expansive nature of Jagger and co \u2013 at least if you take into account how varied the Rolling Stones discography gets after leaping away from garage rock.\n\nWhich is something Styles seems to have emulated and recognized, from his stage presence (which he showed off on James Corden\u2019s Late Late Show all week) to his sense of fashion to the way his album reads like a generous tribute to British rock. No two songs are the same, nor are two tempos. Like Jagger, the singer sings primarily about women, his complicated relationship with them, and the experiences that come with being a young man. What will be interesting is whether he reinvents himself similarly as his career continues \u2013 dance moves and all.\n\nIs this a stretch? Absolutely. But because Just Hold On saw Louis collaborate with Steve Aoki and do his own singing, it seemed the 1D alum was channeling 2017-era Harris (who\u2019s been singing his own songs) while simultaneously maintaining the DJ\u2019s long legacy of working with big names.\n\nIt\u2019s still a generous likening, especially since Louis has only delivered one track with no announcement of a forthcoming full-length. But that could also be a strategy: where his compadres are actively working the circuit, Tomlinson seems content to drop a banger every so often, leaving fans to thirst after him, instead of vice versa. His longevity, however, will depend on whether he gets behind the production board or begins working the DJ booth. Because as great as Calvin\u2019s Harris\u2019 vocals are, I don\u2019t think any of us need entire albums of them.\n\nHere is a thing none of us were prepared for. Where Our Town seemed to solidify Horan as the next Shawn Mendes or Ed Sheeran, Slow Hands was on Bieber-circa-Girlfriend levels of catchy, thanks especially to a slowed-down, seductive beat.\n\nLike Bieber via 2012\u2019s Believe, Slow Hands reintroduced Horan to his fans as an adult. But where Zayn used shock tactics to differentiate himself from his past, Niall borrowed from the pages of Bieber\u2019s book, and used his songwriting to prove he wasn\u2019t just some dude with an acoustic guitar. He could sing well, he could creatively adapt for a grown-up solo venture, and he still cherished his existing fan base and the legacy of his former self. Which Justin did, once upon a time, too: while Bieber leapt from child prodigy to rebel without a cause, his musical evolution never really faltered, and his career was kept afloat by the legacy he refused to condemn or distance himself from. So if Niall considers himself another Bieber, that would be brilliant: he would arguably be setting himself up for even bigger and better success, fortunately too old to relive Justin\u2019s 2013 ventures.\n\nI ... don\u2019t know, you guys. I mean, you can see what Liam wanted to do: he wanted to grow up musically, borrowing from the gospel of Zayn by simultaneously throwing shade at One Direction while singing about sex and parties. The problem is, Strip That Down is even less believable \u2013 partially because Zayn has been candid about his partying and personal turbulence (where Liam is now a father) and because Zayn only ever dissed 1D in interviews, not in his actual music.\n\nHowever, Strip That Down is largely a thirst trap, appealing to a tired brand of heteronormativity through Liam\u2019s references to \u201cgirl\u201d, whoever she may be. (Because my dudes, he\u2019s certainly not speaking to Cheryl that way.)\n\nYou can see the way he takes the Ed Sheeran approach to vocals, but loses the heart by bragging about how many women are hanging off him, and you can also hear the way he\u2019s using the Nick Jonas approach to post-band life by adopting slick beats while peacocking. The thing is, Sheeran and Jonas have both mastered their art by making songs seem sincere or as part of an in-joke with their audiences \u2013 they\u2019re not delivered on a platform built to broadcast their own greatness.\n\nSo here\u2019s hoping that Liam\u2019s next single features more of what he\u2019s actually good at: singing. Because while you know he\u2019s thinking of himself as a cross between Sheeran and Jonas, he\u2019s coming off as a salty brat who has no reason to complain about anything.\n",

Much like Dory, whom we met in the hit 2003 movie Finding Nemo, DeGeneres, 58, is undaunted, kind, strong and loving, swimming on despite the obstacles in her way. But unlike Dory, whose amnesia causes her to remember almost nothing, DeGeneres remembers a whole lot.\n\nThe native of Metairie, Louisiana, hasn\u2019t forgotten the slow road to fame in the 1990s and how her first prime-time comedy series, Ellen, was abandoned by advertisers and the TV network when it flopped, capsized in part by backlash and negative response to her \u201ccoming out\u201d as TV\u2019s highest-profile lesbian. Like Dory, she swam on. She went back to doing stand-up comedy, created her own afternoon-TV talk show and hosted the Emmys, Grammys and the Academy Awards\u2014twice.\n\nIn 2008, DeGeneres married Australian actress/model Portia de Rossi, 43. Both vegans, they share a passion for animal rights, environmental causes and renovating houses. Parade\u2019s Dotson Rader met with DeGeneres in her office on the back lot of the TV studio complex in Burbank, California, where The Ellen DeGeneres Show has been produced for 13 years.\n\nWhat was your childhood like? Was it fun?\n\nI grew up in a very conservative home. My father was a first reader in the Christian Science Church, which is similar to being a preacher. There was no drinking, smoking or cursing. I didn\u2019t see deep emotion from my parents. It was all very polite and very surface. I never knew how anybody was feeling. Because of that religion everything was fine all the time.\n\nIsn\u2019t it dishonest to pretend you\u2019re happy when you\u2019re really angry?\n\nExactly. I never saw anyone angry\u2014so when I was 13 and my parents divorced it was a huge surprise to me because I was told everything was fine. It was very confusing. That\u2019s not a healthy way to grow up. It was very hard to express yourself. A kid should be told that you can have feelings. I have a lot of feelings. You can feel sad and angry and hurt. But the only feeling that was approved of is happiness\u2014that was it. How can you have happiness when you\u2019re not honest?\n\nHow did that emotional repression affect you?\n\nAs a young girl, I noticed things a lot more. I started seeing that things weren\u2019t completely as everyone said they were. I noticed everything because I had to after my parents divorced. At 13, I sort of became the parent, taking care of my mother.\n\nDid that experience influence your comedy?\n\nI think my comedy came from observing little details in life. What is most important are the details, not the broad strokes but noticing what\u2019s in between. One of my first jokes was the fact that when somebody tastes something disgusting, they always want you to taste it\u00a0too, like, \u201cThis is disgusting\u2014taste it!\u201d And people do.\n\nWhy could you see what others never saw?\n\nBecause I was very tender. I was very sensitive, and I still am. I never want to hurt anybody. I want to make people laugh. I didn\u2019t think it was ever funny to make fun of people. There\u2019s so much to laugh at without it being at someone else\u2019s expense.\n\nYou end each TV show by telling your viewers to be kind to each other. Why is kindness so important to you?\n\nBecause I\u2019ve been treated in a way that has not been kind, respectful or considerate. I learned compassion from having experienced some bad stuff.\n\nAfter your parents divorced, you stayed alone with your mom in New Orleans?\n\nYes. My mother was going through a hard time. She dated lots of really horrible men and had bad experiences. She went from being my mother to being somebody I was watching date men. At 13, it\u2019s a weird thing. Then she remarried and had breast cancer right away, a really tough thing for her. I had to make her laugh. [My comedy] started from me trying to make her happy. It felt really good to have power to make people happy. That\u2019s my talent. Not that I thought I\u2019d make money from it.\n\nYou have an older brother, Vance. What happened to him?\n\nHe left, angry. He was 17. He didn\u2019t want to live with either parent. He was in a band. Now we\u2019re very, very close. He\u2019s great. He is very talented and works with my production company.\n\nYou went to the University of New Orleans for less than a semester and dropped out. Why?\n\nSchool just was not interesting to me.\n\nBefore Ellen was Ellen: Do You Remember Her 10 Best TV Appearances?\n\nWere you surprised when ABC abruptly canceled your hit sitcom after your character came out?\n\nIt was a sucker punch. I didn\u2019t expect it. I knew that there was a big chance that this was the end of my career. But I\u2019m grateful for it. I got to start over again and create this talk show. There are people who don\u2019t know about the sitcoms, or my stand-up comedy. They think I\u2019m just a talk show host. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nOn your talk show, everything is positive, despite what may be happening that\u2019s bad in the real world, say in politics.\n\nI don\u2019t do political humor. I never have. Trump is being attacked by everybody because it\u2019s an easy thing to do. Stephen Colbert goes after him every night and so does Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel. A lot of people do. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to make fun of anybody. It\u2019s not who I am.\n\nGet\u00a0a Peek at Ellen\u2019s Quirky Design Style in Her New Book Home\n\nYour show seems unrelentingly happy. It is a happy show, on purpose. I represent happiness to a lot of people. I want to keep myself as open and as nonjudgmental as possible. Before the show was picked up, I think a lot of station managers thought I would have an agenda to try to somehow turn the world gay. People did worry. Our only agenda is to make people feel good. It\u2019s an hour of joy.\n\nYour audience squeals with excited delight a lot. There are people from all over the world who wait three years for tickets. I was in Dubai and this woman said she\u2019d been trying to get tickets for five years. That\u2019s why I created the room [for] leftover people who can\u2019t get in. Tom Hanks named it the Riff Raff Room.\n\nYou live a very public life with a lot of pressures, among them rumors of marital problems with your wife, Portia. I don\u2019t pay attention [to rumors]. But we\u2019ve been followed recently by the paparazzi, and we found out it\u2019s because there\u2019s a story out there that we\u2019re getting divorced. We don\u2019t know why. We\u2019re together all the time. We genuinely love each other. Her happiness is my happiness, and vice versa. True love is caring more about the other person\u2019s happiness than your own.\n\n",

    "text": "\nBush was suspended at the morning show two days after contents of the 2005 tape were reported on October 7.\n\nNBC and Bush's representatives had been negotiating terms of his exit before Monday's announcement.\n\nOn the tape, Bush is heard laughing as Trump talks about fame enabling him to grope and try to have sex with women not his wife. Bush later said he was \"embarrassed and ashamed.\" Trump has since denied groping women.\n\nBush, who had been at Today for two months, is the nephew of Republican former President George H.W. Bush.\n\nNBC made the announcement of his firing in a note from Today show top executive Noah Oppenheim to his staff. Oppenheim called Bush, who spent 15 years at Access Hollywood, \"a valued colleague and longtime member of the broader NBC family. We wish him success as he goes forward.\"\n\nBush, a 44-year-old father of three, said that he was \"deeply grateful for the conversations I've had with my daughters, and for all of the support from family, friends and colleagues. I look forward to what lies ahead.\"\n\nThe settlement with NBC did not include a non-compete clause, meaning Bush \"is a free agent,\" said his lawyer, Marshall Grossman. Financial terms of the deal were kept confidential.\n\nTMZ reports that Bush had just joined NBC's flagship show in August, signing a three-year deal for $3.5 million per year. He was tipped to receive millions in his settlement with NBC.\n\nIn the 2005 tape, which was first revealed by The Washington Post, Trump discusses unsuccessfully seeking an affair with another Access Hollywood employee, Nancy O'Dell. Trump said that when he was attracted to beautiful women \"I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet.\" He said that when you're a star, women let you. \"Grab them by the p----. You can do anything,\" Trump added.\n\nThe two men discussed an actor who was waiting from at the end of the bus ride. When they got off, Bush urged the woman to hug Trump and added, \"how about a little hug for the Bushy?\" Trump said in the second presidential debate that he never did any of the actions heard on the tape, which he described as locker room talk. But a number of women have since come forward and said that Trump had surprised them in the past by groping or unexpectedly kissing them on the lips.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Monday, Trump's wife, Melania, said that her husband was \"egged on\" by Bush in the conversation. \"I wonder if they even knew the mic was on,\" Melania Trump said, referring to her husband and Bush. She said they were involved in \"boy talk, and he was led on - like egged on - from the host to say dirty and bad stuff.\" Asked to comment, Grossman said, \"I thought that Donald Trump would claim that he was not on the bus.\"\n",

Her \"Soul Food Sundays\" have gotten the approval of her husband Kanye West, friends Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, and everyone in between - and now, a source tells People that their encouragement has led her to want to write her own cookbook.\n\n\"Kim is starting to cook so much more than she has in her entire life,\" the source said. \"She's actually considering a cookbook, and she's pretty serious about it. It all started with Kanye's encouragement as he loved when she cooks him food.\"\n\nThe source told People that Kim has been \"testing the waters\" to see if her fans would be interested in the cookbook by posting more food content to social media. So far, the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and she's even started consulting with Chrissy - who recently published her own cookbook, Cravings - for tips and recipes.\n\nThere's no word yet on when, if ever, Kim's cookbook would come out, but here's hoping it includes North's favorite recipe for beignets if it does.\n",

    "text": "\nRemember Pepsi\u2019s tone-deaf Kendall Jenner commercial back in April? The one\u00a0that made people furious, because it appropriated images from Black Lives Matter protests to sell soda?\n\nPepsi quickly pulled the ad after intense criticism \u2014 and in the six months since the controversy, Kendall hasn\u2019t publicly responded. That\u2019s because\u00a0she saved\u00a0it all\u00a0for the 14th season premiere of E!\u2019s \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d which aired Sunday night.\u00a0The Kardashian family has said that Kendall was very upset over the backlash, and the premiere confirmed that, yes, the 21-year-old supermodel was\u00a0mortified.\n\nAlthough the episode ended with\u00a0Kendall sobbing (\u201cObviously, if I knew that this was going to be the outcome, I would have never done something like this\u201d), it was a slow build to her breakdown. In fact, the word \u201cPepsi\u201d never came up during the entire hour. It all started as\u00a0Kendall called her sisters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kourtney said when she answered the phone. \u201cYou sound so sad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI talked to Simon today,\u201d Kourtney said, likely referring to Simon Huck, a public relations guru and Kim Kardashian West\u2019s close friend. \u201cHe was like, \u2018The news lasts 24 hours.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCut to an on-camera interview with Khloe, who explained to the audience: \u201cKendall did a commercial and basically caused a huge controversy. It sucks, because Kendall\u2019s been taking the blame for it all. Kendall tries really hard to be socially conscious and aware of the jobs that she takes and to really think about how things affect other people, so it weighs really heavy on her heart.\u201d\n\nProducers showed some critical tweets about the commercial, such as, \u201cSo many adults had to f\u2011\u2011\u2011 up in so many unique and equally tone deaf ways to make this awful ad, it\u2019s honestly breathtaking.\u201d\n\nKourtney assured Kendall that she spoke to family friend Russell Simmons, who said that Kendall \u201ccan turn this into a positive.\u201d This is never further explained.\u00a0After they hung up,\u00a0Kourtney told Khloe that it sounded like Kendall was crying.\n\nLater, Kendall explained why she filmed the commercial in the first place \u2014 when she got the offer, she was thrilled to join the list of celebrities who have done Pepsi ads, from Michael Jackson to Beyonc\u00e9 to Britney Spears.\n\n\u201cI trusted everyone. I trusted the teams,\u201d she\u00a0told the camera. \u201cBut after I saw the reaction and I read what people had to say about it, I most definitely saw what went wrong. I was so stuck, and I really didn\u2019t know what to do, that I completely shut down.\u201d\n\nThe following scene showed Kendall sitting forlornly in her gigantic walk-in closet, talking to Kim on the phone. The new issue? Her father, Caitlyn Jenner, was going on a book tour.\u00a0Kendall was worried that Caitlyn might say something about the commercial that would make things worse.\n\n\u201cShe just tends to, like, say a lot, and I just would rather everyone just not say anything,\u201d Kendall said.\u00a0\u201cI mean, God bless her for trying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. But Caitlyn is known for saying all the wrong things,\u201d Kim said. She promised to call Caitlyn and let her know it was a very sensitive subject.\n\nSo Kim called Caitlyn and told her not to answer questions about the Pepsi ad \u2014 and if she felt compelled, just say something along the lines of, \u201cKendall had the best intentions with this being something, like, peaceful, and she totally gets everyone\u2019s point of view now. It was not appropriate, and she\u2019s so sorry.\u201d\n\nNaturally, Caitlyn did not follow that advice, and instead\u00a0talked about the commercial in a radio interview and said Kendall knew all about the ad\u2019s script beforehand and thought it was fine.\u00a0The episode ended as Kendall went to talk to Kim, about three weeks after the commercial was pulled.\u00a0She was upset about Caitlyn, and even more about the whole situation.\n\n\u201cI just feel really, really bad. Like, I feel really bad that anyone was ever offended. I feel really bad that this was taken such a wrong way,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cI genuinely feel like s\u2011\u2011\u2011, and I have no idea how I\u2019m going to bounce back from it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first time you\u2019ve had a scandal,\u201d Kim gently reminded her. \u201cThis is your first real experience with something like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe text messages I would get from people, they\u2019d be like, \u2018It\u2019s going to be fine, like, you know everything blows over in, like, a week\u2019s time\u2019 or whatever. And I\u2019m just like, \u2018Okay, but it\u2019s been, like, three weeks and it\u2019s not going anywhere,\u2019 \u201d Kendall said.\n\n\u201cYeah, but it will,\u201d Kim assured her. \u201cThis is just going to be the biggest lesson learned for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t even know what to do at this point. It\u2019s really depressing, and it bothers me every single day,\u201d Kendall said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the last person to want to hurt someone or be insensitive, but it\u2019s, like, it really sucks. I think the only thing you can really do is just be real and honest, because you can\u2019t ignore it. Like, you can\u2019t,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt should affect you in a way where you grow from it, and you\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m a better person from it.\u2019 .\u2009.\u2009. I just wish that you could see that there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\nDespite Kim\u2019s words of wisdom, Kendall still broke down crying to the camera.\n\n\u201cI would never purposely hurt someone, ever,\u201d Kendall said tearfully. \u201cYou don\u2019t know when you\u2019re in the moment, and, like, it was the most \u2014\u201d She grappled for the right words. \u201cI just felt so f\u2011\u2011\u2011ing stupid. The fact that I would offend other people or hurt other people was definitely not the intent. And that\u2019s what got me the most, is that I would have ever made anyone else upset.\u201d\n\nAfter Pepsi pulled the ad, the company apologized\u00a0for putting Kendall Jenner in an awkward position. Last week, Pepsi chief executive Indra Nooyi\u00a0told Fortune\u00a0that\u00a0she didn\u2019t initially see the ad\u2019s final scene that caused so much \u201cconsternation,\u201d in which Jenner handed a cop a can of Pepsi.\n\n\u201cThis has pained me a lot because this company is known for diversity, and the fact that everybody who produced the commercial and approved the commercial did not link it to Black Lives Matter made me scratch my head. I had not seen that scene,\u201d Nooyi said. \u201cAnd I take everything personally. The minute I saw people upset, I pulled it. And you know what, it\u2019s not worth it. There were people on both sides, but at the end of the day, our goal is not to offend anybody.\u201d\n\n\u2018Clearly we missed the mark\u2019: Pepsi pulls Kendall Jenner ad and apologizes\n\nThe Kardashians aren\u2019t thrilled with Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s new book\n",

They were \"probably just having fun or something,\" she said.\n\nSince rekindling their relationship at the beginning of 2016, Miley and Liam have appeared happier than ever, with Miley even getting a tattoo dedicated to her man.\n\nLiam has professed his love for Vegemite countless times in interviews, which is why everyone's convinced it's for him.\n\nTheir love story 2.0 started when Miley and Liam hung out over Christmas and New Year in 2015. \"Miley came back to LA after spending the holidays with Liam. She had the time of her life being with him and his family,\" a source told E! News at the time.\n\nMiley also set tongues wagging when she posed for a photo on Instagram wearing the engagement ring Liam gave her the first time around...\n\nTo be fair, if we had a 3.5-carat, custom-designed Neil Lane engagement ring we would never take it off.\n\nIt was back in April 2016, the pair were spotted out together for the first time...\n\nWhen we first heard the news that old flames Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth were back together after splitting back in 2013, we were thrilled.\n\nAn insider told E News! at the time that Liam's family is pleased to have Miley back in their life, and think that they can make it work now that they're older.\n\n\"Liam never stopped loving Miley. Liam and Miley's timing was just off the first time they were engaged, many things played into them calling it off,\" an insider told the website.\n\n\"They both needed to grow up and figure themselves out more.\n\n\"Liam's family... always liked Miley but they supported Liam's decision at the time. They did feel that both of them were too young.\"\n\nThe source added, \"They are in love and it's a different time now for them.\"\n\nBack in 2015, when the pair had broken up, Liam opened up about his five year relationship with Miley saying his feelings for her will never change.\n\nWhen asked if he felt like he'd \"dodged a bullet,\" he said: \"You fall in love with who you fall in love with; you can never choose. I guess some people just come with a little more baggage.\n\n\"I mean, look-we were together five years, so I don't think those feelings will ever change. And that's good because that proves to me that it was real. It wasn't just a fling. It really was an important part of my life and always will be,\" he told Men's Fitness.\n\n\nHe continued: \"She's a free spirit. I think she'll always surprise people with what she does, but she's not a malicious person in any way. She's a young girl who wants to do what she wants to do.\"\n\nLikewise, Miley told Australian talk show host Chris Bath: \"I love Liam, Liam loves me\".\n\n",

In her new book, British comedy actress Cleo Rocos says that she, Queen front man Freddie Mercury, and comedian Kenny Everett sneaked Princess Diana into a south-London gay bar, Royal Vauxhall Tavern, in the late 1980s. Rocos recalls the evening in The Power of Positive Drinking, writing that the trio dressed up the beloved late royal in disguise-an army jacket, cap, and sunglasses, according to an account of the story by the A.F.P.-and were able to enjoy themselves covertly thanks to Mercury's popularity in the crowd:\n\nShe said she did not know whether Diana was propositioned in the bar in her guise as a male model, but added: \"She did look like a beautiful young man.\"\n\nRocos also claims that Diana enjoyed herself so much that she told the group, \"We must do it again!\" afterward. Amazingly, the undercover gay-bar excursion was not the only activity on the foursome's agenda that day. Per Rocos's recollections, the group spent the afternoon before the trip \"drinking champagne in front of reruns of The Golden Girls with the sound turned down\" and improvising show dialogue with \"a much naughtier storyline.\" After asking about the group's plans that night, Diana, \"in full mischief mode,\" insisted on joining. Although Rocos and Everett tried to dissuade her, worried about unsavory headlines if she were detected by paparazzi, Mercury proved the deciding vote, telling them, \"Go on, let the girl have some fun.\"\n\nDiana married into the royal family on July 29, 1981.\n",

    "text": "\nIt was announced in January that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be moving to London later this year, settling in the capital for the long term from Autumn.\n\nWith the Duke and Duchess planning to take on more royal engagements and Prince George, 3, due to start school at Thomas\u2019s London Day School in Battersea from September, a move for the family of four made sense.\n\nAnnouncing the news, they released an official statement: \u2018Their Royal Highnesses love their time in Norfolk and it will continue to be their home. From this autumn, however, the Duke and Duchess will increasingly base their family at Kensington Palace. As they have in recent years, their royal Highnesses are keen to continue to increase their official work on behalf of the Queen and for the charities and causes they support, which will require greater time spent in London.\u2019\n\nWith the move scheduled to take place in the coming months, it comes as no surprise that the Duke and Duchess are already starting to make Kensington Palace ready for the family or four (plus Lupo the cocker spaniel).\n\nHaving renovated the palace a few years back in a \u00a31 million revamp, Kate Middleton is said to be enlisting the help of interior designer to the stars, Ben Pentreath, to help give the palace a more homely vibe.\n\nThe designer, who helped decorate her Norfolk home, Amner Hall, and who boasts a star-studded client list from Liv Tyler to Sarah Jessica Parker, is said to be helping Kate to decorate and furnish apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, giving it a traditional and luxurious feel.\n\nAccording to Hello! magazine, the Duchess has gone for a neutral colour palette, decorating her drawing room with traditional furnishings from long floor-length curtains, plants and tapestry rugs, to cream lamps and gold framed artwork. There\u2019s also said to be a few modern additions, including an octagonal coffee table and some fluffy cushions.\n\nWe\u2019re getting some serious interiors envy already \u2013 If you\u2019ll excuse us we\u2019re off to buy some cream lamps and fluffy cushions.\n",

    "text": "\nThis January marks the tenth anniversary of the Beatles' appearance on the American charts. Last month Rolling Stone conducted its first full-scale interview with Paul McCartney, in six sessions starting in a London recording studio and ending on a New York street. The New York sessions took place the day after McCartney had entered the US for the first time in two years, visa problems stemming from two marijuana violations now finally resolved.\n\nMcCartney was cautious in his responses during the first two sessions. He and Linda remembered being on vacation in Scotland when they were first shown John Lennon's lengthy interview (Rolling Stone Number 74 and Number 75, January 21st and February 4th, 1971), and having been deeply hurt by it. At first he seemed to want to avoid the kind of controversy Lennon's interview had generated but in later conversations he became freer with his answers.\n\nBecause the various sessions were necessarily disconnected, our text does not follow in all cases the actual sequence of questions. For example, McCartney's discussion of his legal difficulties is compiled from three separate conversations. One of those discussions was prompted by an incident on a New York street. We were walking down 54th Street towards the New York office of Eastman and Eastman, attorneys \u2013 Lee and John Eastman, father and brother of Linda McCartney (whose photographs illustrate this interview).\n\nA man in a gray suit with a colorful umbrella approached McCartney and asked, \"Mr. McCartney? This is for you.\" It was an American copy of a process from Allen Klein that had been served on Paul two weeks before in London. An outraged PR man howled; McCartney smiled and told the man, \"Thank you very much.\" He was being sarcastic.\n\nThe villain of the scenario, so far as he was concerned, was not the man in the gray suit, but Klein himself, whom McCartney calls a \"punk.\" McCartney claims he sued his fellow ex-Beatles in High Court because it was the only way to sue Klein. When we queried the head of ABKCO Industries about the suit, he seemed to relish the new confrontation. \"He now has the opportunity to say anything he wants in court,\" Klein told us. \"He has his opportunity to fight me face to face. I am welcoming it. Now he's in the same ring with me. Isn't that what he wanted?\"\n\nJohn Eastman made this statement concerning the Beatles/Apple/Klein suits and Paul's involvement in them:\n\n\"John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, Apple and others started an action in England against ABKCO and Klein. This complaint alleges ABKCO and Klein took excessive commissions, practiced fraud, suggested conduct which would have been a fraud on the tax authorities in the US and UK, mismanaged Bangla Desh and otherwise mismanaged the affairs of the complainant. This action is now pending against ABKCO and Klein.\n\n\"ABKCO then sued Lennon, Harrison, Starr, Yoko Ono, Apple and other related companies in the US. It claims damages against them of $63,461,372.87 plus future earnings.\n\n\"ABKCO also joined Paul, claiming conspiracy. Its only claim against Paul is that Paul conspired with Yoko Ono, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr as well as Bag Production and other corporations wantonly, maliciously, fraudulently, wrongfully and intentionally without justification in law or fact to damage or injure plaintiff (ABKCO).' Damages are sought for this alleged conspiracy of $34 million plus interest.\"\n\nOur interviews were delayed some months, first by a Wings tour and later by a series of recording sessions in Nigeria. Even after that wait, the McCartneys seemed surprised at how much we wanted to know. In the end they were interviewed in a London recording studio, Paul's Soho office, Lee Eastman's offices and apartment in New York (where baby Stella McCartney wore the interviewer's watch on her foot) and the studio of cover photographer Francesco Scavullo. As the interview begins, Paul is telling how he wrote one of the songs he recorded in Nigeria.\n\n\u2013 P.G.\n\nWe were in Jamaica on holiday and we were staying in a little house outside Montego Bay, and we read in the local newspaper, The Daily Gleaner, that Dustin Hoffman and Steve McQueen were in town filming Papillon. They were just along the coast from us. We were saying it would be great to meet him, have dinner with him, so Linda rang up. She's good at that, I'm always a bit embarrassed.\n\nWe got friendly and were chatting away. We'd been talking about songwriting, and Dustin was saying he thought it was an incredible gift to be able to write a song about something. People think that, but I always maintain it's the same as any gift. It probably is more magical because it's music, and I think it is more magical. But take his acting talent. It's great. I was saying, \"It's the same as you and acting, when the man says 'Action!' you just pull it out of the bag, don't you? You don't know where it comes from, you just do it! How do you get all of your characterizations? It's just in you.\n\nSo he says, \"You mean you can just do it, like that?\" He was lovely, Dustin. [Does Dustin Hoffman impersonation.] \"You can just do it?\" We went back a couple of days later and he said, \"I've been thinking about this, I've seen a little thing in Time magazine about Picasso, and it struck me as being very poetic. I think this would be really great set to music.\" It was one of those Passed On bits, you know, Transition or whatever they call it. ... [Sees unusually dressed studio assistant.] ... Transvestite. ... So he says there's a little story here. In the article he supposedly said, \"Drink to me, drink to my health, you know I can't drink any more.\" He went to paint a bit, and then he went to bed at three in the morning. He didn't wake up the next morning and they found him, dead.\n\nI happened to have my guitar with me, I'd brought it around, and I said, yeah, sure. I strummed a couple of chords I knew I couldn't go wrong on and started singing \"Drink to me, drink to my health,\" and he leaps out of his chair and says, \"Annie! Annie!\" That's his wife. He says, \"Annie! Annie! The most incredible thing! He's doing it! He's writing it! It's coming out!\" He's leaping up and down, just like in the films, you know. And I'm knocked out because he's so appreciative. I was writing the tune there and he was well-chuffed.\n\nThen we went to Nigeria and we were working in Ginger's studio \u2013 Ginger Baker/ARC Studio in Lagos, nice studio down there. We thought we'd do this Picasso number, and we started off doing it straight. Then we thought, Picasso was kind of far out in his pictures, he'd done all these different kinds of things, fragmented, Cubism and the whole bit. I thought it would be nice to get a track a bit like that, put it through different moods, cut it up, edit it, mess around with it \u2013 like he used to do with his pictures. You see the old films of him painting, he paints it once and if he doesn't like it he paints it again, right on top of it, and by about 25 times he's got his picture. So we tried to use this kind of idea, I don't know much about it to tell you the truth, but what we did know we tried to get in the song, sort of a Cubist thing.\n\n\nThen there was the trouble in Nigeria with Fela Ransome Kuti [Ex-Ginger Baker's Air Force].\nYou heard about that? All it was was we were recording in Lagos. Lately we've gone to two different places to record, just for the fun of it. We've been to Lagos and to Paris and in both of the places they say, \"Why did you come here? You've got much better studios in England or America, you must be daft!\" And we say, \"Well, it's just for the fun, it's just to come somewhere different for a different type of turn-on, that's all.\" They never really seem to be able to understand it. I think old Fela, when he found us in Lagos, thought, \"Hello, why have they come to Lagos?\" And the only reason he could think of was that we must be stealing black music, black African music, the Lagos sound, we'd come down there to pick it up. So I said, \"Do us a favor, we do OK as it is, we're not pinching your music.\"\n\nThey felt that they have their own little ethnic thing going and these big foreigners are taking all their bit and beating them back to the West with it. Because they have a lot of difficulty getting their sound heard in the West. There's not an awful lot of demand, except for things like, what was it, \"Soul Makossa.\" Except for that kind of thing they don't really get heard.\n\nAnd they are brilliant, it's incredible music down there. I think it will come to the fore. And I thought my visit would, if anything, help them, because it would draw attention to Lagos and people would say, \"Oh, by the way, what's the music down there like?\" and I'd say it was unbelievable. It is unbelievable. When I heard Fela Ransome Kuti the first time, it made me cry, it was that good.\n\nYou've just had some musicians leave, haven't you?\nOur drummer [Denny Seiwell] didn't want to come to Africa. I don't know quite why. He was a bit nervous about coming to Africa. We're all going to Africa to record and if the drummer won't come, what do you do? You don't say, \"Well, we'll see you when we get back, thanks a lot we understand.\" You say, \"Well, er, ummm,\" and he leaves.\n\nI think [guitarist] Henry McCulloch came to a head one day when I was asking him to play something he didn't really fancy playing. We all got a bit choked about it, and he rang up later and said he was leaving. I said, \"Well, OK.\" That's how that happened. You know, with the kind of music we play, a guitarist has got to be a bit adaptable. It was just one of those things. I don't think there was anything wrong with them as musicians, they were both good musicians, but they just didn't fit in.\n\nIn the film 'A Hard Day's Night,' there were the stereotypes \u2013 if you remember John the thinker, Ringo the loner, and Paul the happy-go-lucky. Did you object to that?\nNo, I didn't mind it. No, no; I still don't. I was in a film. I don't care what they picture me as. So far as I'm concerned I'm just doing a job in a film. If the film calls for me to be a cheerful chap, well, great; I'll be a cheerful chap.\n\nIt does seem to have fallen in my role to be kind of a bit more that than others. I was always known in the Beatle thing as being the one who would kind of sit the press down and say, \"Hello, how are you? Do you want a drink?\" and make them comfortable. I guess that's me. My family loop was like that. So I kind of used to do that, plus a little more polished than I might normally have done, but you're aware you're talking to the press. ... You want a good article, don't you, so you don't want to go sluggin' the guys off.\n\nBut I'm not ashamed of anything I've been, you know. I kind of like the idea of doing something and if it turns out in a few years to look a bit sloppy I'd say, \"Oh well, sloppy. So what?\" I think most people dig it. You get people livin' out in Queens or say Red Creek, Minnesota, and they're all wiped out themselves ... you know, ordinary people. Once you get into the kind of critical bit, people analyzing you and then you start to look at yourself and start to analyze yourself, and you think, oh Christ, you got me, and things start to rebound on ya, why didn't I put on a kind of smart image ... you know, why wasn't I kind of tougher? I'm not really tough. I'm not really lovable, either, but I don't mind falling in the middle. My dad's advice: moderation, son. Every father in the world tells you moderation. [Linda laughs hysterically in the background.]\n\nBritish parents aren't different ...\nNo, they're exactly the same. My dad could be the perfect American stereotype father. He's a good lad, though; I like him, you know.\n\nI tell you what. I think that a lot of people worried about that kind of stuff didn't often have very good family scenes, and something happened in their family to make them bitter. OK, in the normal day-to-day life a lot of polished talk goes on ... you don't love everyone you meet, but you try and get on with people, you know, you don't try and put 'em up-tight; most people don't anyway.\n\nSo to me that's always been the way. I mean, there's nothin' wrong with that; why should I go around slugging people? I really didn't like all that John did. But I'm sure that he doesn't now.\n\nHave you talked to him about that?\nNo, but I know John and I know that most of it was just something to tell the newspapers. He was in that mood then and he wanted all that to be said. I think, now, whilst he probably doesn't regret it, he didn't mean every single syllable of it. I mean, he came out with all stuff like I'm like Engelbert Humperdinck. I know he doesn't really think that. In the press, they really wanted me to come out and slam John back and I used to get pissed at the guys coming up to me and saying, \"This is the latest thing John said and what's your answer.\" And I'd say, \"Well, don't really have much of an answer. He's got a right to say ...\" \u2013 you know, really limp things, I'd answer. But I believe keep cool and that sort of thing and it passes over. I don't believe if someone kind of punches you over you have to go kind of thumping him back to prove you're a man and that kind of thing. I think, actually, you do win that way in the end, you know.\n\nWhat was your reaction when you read that stuff at the time?\nOh, I hated it. You can imagine, I sat down and pored over every little paragraph, every little sentence. \"Does he really think that of me?\" I thought. And at the time, I thought, \"It's me. I am. That's just what I'm like. He's captured me so well; I'm a turd, you know.\" I sat down and really thought, I'm just nothin'. But then, well, kind of people who dug me like Linda said, \"Now you know that's not true, you're joking. He's got a grudge, man; the guy's trying to polish you off.\" Gradually I started to think, great, that's not true. I'm not really like Engelbert; I don't just write ballads. And that kept me kind of hanging on; but at the time, I tell you, it hurt me. Whew. Deep.\n\nCould you write a song or songs with John again?\nI could. It's totally fresh ground, right now, 'cause I just got my visa, too. About two or three days ago; and until then, I couldn't physically write a song with John; he was in America. He couldn't get out. I couldn't get in. But now that's changed so whole new possibilities are opening up. Anything could happen. I like to write with John. I like to write with anyone who's good.\n\nRight now you yourself are working on The Mouse Gang.\nNo, it's not the Mouse Gang, it's a show that will be called the Bruce McMouse Show.\n\nI was thinking of The Zoo Gang.\nThe Zoo Gang, that's right, that's just a theme tune for a television show I was asked to do. Bruce McMouse is another thing. We filmed the last couple of dates at the end of Wings' first European tour. Bruce lives under the stage, you see. [Bruce and his family are animated and their exploits are spliced in between Wings' footage for a television film.]\n\nAre you constantly deluged with this type of offer?\nNot deluged. I get quite a few, you know. I just try and choose the ones I like the sound of. It's not anything I plan out. I remember a thing in Rolling Stone \u2013 there's a little bit of chat, I read the papers, you know \u2013 that said \"McCartney's going to do Live and Let Die, so it's come to that, has it?\" I thought, you silly sods. Because we were talking to another paper and when I said I was going to do Live and Let Die, the 007 thing, the reporter said, \"Hey, man, that's real hip.\" So it just depends which way you look at it.\n\n\"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\" was the first of your singles in eight years that didn't sell in America and Britain.\nBefore I did that, I always used to think, God, John's crackers, doing all these political songs. I understand he really feels deeply, you know. So do I. I hate all that Nixon bit, all that Ireland bit, and oppression anywhere. I think our mob do, our generation do hate that and wish it could be changed, but up until the actual time when the paratroopers went in and killed a few people, a bit like Kent State, the moment when it is actually there on the doorstep, I always used to think it's still cool to not say anything about it, because it's not going to sell anyway and no one's gonna be interested.\n\nSo I tried it, it was Number One in Ireland and, funnily enough, it was Number One in Spain, of all places. I don't think Franco could have understood.\n\n[At this point Paul receives word that a playback of Bruce McMouse is beginning in the control room. He excuses himself and we chat with Linda while Denny Laine plays a medley of Tim Hardin songs on the studio piano.]\n\nDid you feel scared when McCartney was released, since that was your debut and the first song was pegged at you?\nNo. I didn't take it as seriously as I probably should have. I think it was good copy at the time to slag everything. Everybody was getting slagged, the Beatles were getting slagged. I personally didn't realize you had to explain yourself a lot once you get into the public eye. I just carried on with my normal life, like I had in New York, and I just got all this slagging. It never really brought me down much, though.\n\nDo you think any Mrs. McCartney in that situation would have been slagged?\nI think in what was going down then, yes. There was so much trouble for everybody, not done by one particular person, that everybody was getting blamed. I still can't look at it from the angle that I'm Mrs. McCartney. You know what I mean? I still see me as the person I've always been, either you like me or you don't. Paul likes me. [Laughter.]\n\nAnd stood up for you during the slagging.\nHe was living with me, he knows I'm a good chick, he knows I don't have any bad motives. I'm not a grabber, I'm not any of that. He wouldn't have married me if I had been. So he stuck by me.\n\nI just read totally bizarre stuff about myself. People would do an article on me and then an article on Yoko from childhood on up. I couldn't believe it. It was total fantasy. I mean, none of that happened, folks.\n\nUnlike John, who went to a solo career, Paul went to a group.\nJohn didn't really go to a solo career, there was the Plastic Ono Band and that. But Paul is very much a teamwork person. He doesn't like working just on his own. He still gets nervous. He likes working with people, bouncing off people and having them bounce off him. He likes helping people.\n\n\nHave you ever entertained the thought of doing a record by yourself?\nNot Linda McCartney's Great Single, no. I fool around with the songs I write, but I don't take it as a serious career.\n\nYou do have the novelty single coming up?\nYes. I did a song, \"Seaside Woman,\" right after we'd been to Jamaica, about three or four years ago, I guess. Very reggae-inspired. That's when ATV was suing us saying I was incapable of writing, so Paul said, \"Get out and write a song.\" And then about a week ago we went in to do a B side for it of something I'd written in Africa, some chords I wrote in Africa, and we just talk over it. It's very sort of Fifties R&B, the Doves, the Penguins. I love that, that was my era. I'm New York, you know, Alan Freed and the whole bit.\n\nWe're going to put the single out under the name Suzi and the Red Stripes. When we were in Jamaica, there had been a fantastic reggae version of \"Suzi Q,\" so they used to call me Suzi. And the beer in Jamaica is called Red Stripe, so that makes it Suzi and the Red Stripes. It'll be out someday, but I've been saying \"Seaside Woman\" will be released since 1971 and we still haven't bothered. It's a bit like my photography book. Someday there will be a book.\n\nWas it strictly through you that your father became associated with Paul as his lawyer?\nIt's through me, actually. I remember saying to my father, when I'd met Paul a few times but wasn't living with him, after Brian died, that he had helped a lot of people out of messes, could he help? He said well, I don't know. I said it would be great because I know you could help them out. So then I introduced Paul to my dad, and they got along instantly. If he hadn't met my father, Klein would have just hawked right in there.\n\n[At this point we retire to the control room. Linda goes over the Walt Disney Christmas show script, then talks on the phone to someone at EMI. \"I think the only bit we'd like to add is a little bit from 101 Dalmatians ...\"\n\n[Paul talks to the engineer of Dark Side of the Moon. They marvel at its sales record, and the engineer notes that Pink Floyd are going to give him a Christmas present. \"Ask for a percentage,\" McCartney recommends. \"It's the best present they could give you. What that album has done so far is amazing. In France, it's outsold Abbey Road ...\"]\n\nHow did you meet Linda?\nLinda and I met in a club in London called the Bag of Nails, which was right about the time that the club scene was going strong in London. She was down there with some friends. I think she was down there with Chas Chandler and some other people, and I was down there with some friends, including a guy who used to work at the office. I was in my little booth and she was in her little booth and we were giving each other the eye you know. Georgie Fame was playing that night and we were both right into Georgie Fame.\n\nWhen did you first realize you wanted to marry her?\nAbout a year later. We both thought it a bit crazy at the time, and we also thought it would be a gas. Linda was a bit dubious, because she had been married before and wasn't too set on settling. In a way, she thought it tends to blow things, marrying ruins it. But we both fancied each other enough to do it. And now we're glad we did it, you know. It's great. I love it.\n\nSome of the critical notices on her debut performances seemed to ask where she had come from.\nYeah. Well, the answer is, nowhere, really.\n\nMick Jagger had that quote. He wouldn't let...\n... his old lady in the band, yeah. That was all very understandable at the time because she did kind of appear out of nowhere. To most people, she was just some chick. I just figure she was the main help for me on the albums around that time. She was there every day, helping on harmonies and all of that stuff.\n\nIt's like you write millions of love songs and finally when you're in love you'd kind of like to write one for the person you're in love with. So I think all this business about getting Linda in the billing was just a way of saying, \"Listen, I don't care what you think, this is what I think. I'm putting her right up there with me.\"\n\nLater we thought it might have been cooler not to introduce her so bluntly. Perhaps a little more show business: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to my better half. Isn't she sweet and coy?\"\n\nIt turns out it didn't matter, it didn't matter one bit. At the time it was a little rough, maybe. At the time it was rough for her. None of us realized what ... it was like someone marrying Mick, you don't realize ... you know there's going to be a lot of fans who are going to hate it, but you still end up thinking, well, it's my life. I know of a lot of rock & roll stars or just even show business people who will regulate their life to their image. It can mess you up a lot. I know a lot of guys from the old days who wouldn't get married, even if they wanted to. Wouldn't get married because it might affect their careers. The old management thing \u2013 \"You can't get married, all your fans are going to desert you.\" So the guy doesn't get married.\n\nBut the thing is, in a couple of years, his career is over anyway. And he didn't get married, and he went and blew it. So I didn't. \"Well, I'm not going to let that kind of thing interfere with me.\" Although I didn't wish to blow my career, I thought it was more important to get on with living. We went ahead and just did what we felt like doing. Some of it came out possibly a bit offensive to some people, but it turns out that it didn't matter in the first place. You just keep going.\n\nDid your friends in music stick by you at that time or did you find it a little tough? Or did you have that many friends at the time?\nI remember Ringo saying at the time \"How many friends have I got?\" and he couldn't count them on one hand. And that's what it boils down to, really. You can have millions of friends, but when someone asks you how many friends you've got, it depends on how honestly you're going to answer. Because I don't think I have that many. No one went against me or anything, I think I isolated myself a bit. It's just one of those things. We had just met for the first time. We're very romantic, the both of us, and we didn't really want to hang out with anyone else.\n\nDo you often go back to Liverpool?\nWe visit to keep in touch with the Liverpool scene. My family roots are up there, our kids love, it, and my brother still lives there. In fact, we're going to make an album with him in January.\n\nWill it come out as a Mike McGear album?\nThat's right. It's a singing thing, he's quit comedy for the moment. We're going to do it at Strawberry Studios in Stockport. We'll play it by ear, it's Mike's album.\n\nIs it difficult for the kids, being your daughters?\nI don't think so, I don't think they're going to be crazed-out kids. But it is funny sometimes. I remember I was sitting in a field and Heather was leading Mary and a little baby on a pony, and Mary just said to me, \"You're Paul McCartney, aren't you?\" When she's talking to me normally, she'll just call me Daddy. When there's company around, she knows I'm Paul McCartney, in inverted commas.\n\nIt's nice that we have all girls. If we had a son it might be harder on him, like Frank Sinatra, Jr. Everyone assumes he'll turn out to be his dad. At the moment, there's not much to worry about with the kids.\n\nAt your Oxford press conference you mentioned your four-year-old daughter liked the Osmonds. Linda says your ten-year-old daughter is a bit off them now ...\nYes, she is a bit...\n\n...but I understand you met the Osmonds in Paris, which is a very unusual situation. It must have been as much of a thrill for them to meet you as it would be for a four-year-old to meet them.\nA layer cake of generations.\n\nAs we're talking today three of the Top Six here [England] are by them, which is the greatest chart domination by a group since 1964.\nThey're very liked here by a lot of the record buyers, which in Britain are the young kids.\n\nFrom your personal experience, do you think they can understand how much they mean to people?\nSure they know, sure. I think Little Jimmy probably knows less than the others what's going on, but they seem to. They've got that kind of American showbiz family feeling, which does work. You can put it down, but it really does work. They've been doing it for years on The Andy Williams Show, and they're troupers already. You know, the kid's only eight or something, Little Jimmy, but he's already a little trouper. He has what a seasoned performer has.\n\nWhen you were in their position, did you feel a sense of responsibility, or did you feel the world had gone crazy?\nNo, no. We were a band who'd been trying to make it big for a long time. When you're trying to get to the top, when you start to get there, that's probably the biggest thrill. You don't think the whole world's gone crazy; you think it's great that they like you and you're well-chuffed that you're going down so well. That's all that enters your head. I think that even Little Jimmy just thinks, \"Hey, man, that's great, that's far-out.\" You know? He just loves it. And that's really the best way.\n\nWhen you get thinking too heavily about all of this stuff, like anything, you can do so many doublethinks on it all you end up with is not liking it, which is the only hang up. When you end up not liking it then you start to do it less well. I always thought, just great, great band, great things, kids screaming, fantastic, fabulous, great, everyone's having a good night out. That sort of thing, basically.\n\n\nWere you frightened of possible negative reaction when you released your solo album, McCartney? It was your first break from the Beatles.\nI was as confident as I ever am about any LP. I realize it was more kind of throwaway and done at home than any of the previous ones, but that wasn't a reason to worry about it. You never know what people are going to think about a record anyway.\n\nThe handout on the British edition of McCartney didn't appear in America. Why was that?\nLinda and I did a mail-out from our house. We had made up this little interview for friends and the press and sent them out with about the first hundred albums. Somebody thought it was supposed to be a thing that came with the album, probably because we didn't explain it in the mailing. We should have said. \"Enclosed find press kit.\" People got the idea it came with the album, but it didn't come out in Britain in the copies in the stores.\n\nI had asked Peter Brown [of Apple] for a list of questions he thought might have interesting answers. Looking back, it seems a bit blunt and weird, but at the time it wasn't meant to be. Things like, \"Are you gonna be another John and Yoko?\" \"No, we're gonna be a Paul and Linda.\" Little silly things like that.\n\nHow did you feel people would react to Linda's presence?\nShe was on Let It Be doing backup vocals. That was her first appearance, and nobody said much about that. The time we did McCartney, as it was largely recorded in the back room, she was always there. That was how she came to be on the album as much as she was.\n\nYou did have the release date close to Let It Be.\nThere was some hassle at the time. We were arguing over who had mentioned a release date first. It was all a bit petty. I'd pegged a release date and then Let It Be was scheduled near it. I saw it as victimization, but now I'm sure it wasn't.\n\nSeeing that Let It Be was released basically after the fact, do you wish it had not been released?\nOh, no. I don't wish that about anything. Everything seems to take its place in history after it's happened and it's fine to let it stay there.\n\nIt was the first album to have the little bits on, like the type that also appeared on McCartney.\nI rather fancied having just the plain tapes and nothing done to them at all. We had thought of doing something looser before, but the albums always turned out to be well-produced. That was the idea of the whole album. All the normal things that you record that are great and have all this atmosphere but aren't brilliant recordings or production jobs normally are left out and wind up on, say, Pete Townshend's cutting floor. It ends up with the rest of his demos.\n\nBut all that stuff is often stuff I love. It's got the door opening, the banging of the tape recorder, a couple of people giggling in the background. When you've got friends around, those are the kind of tracks you play them. You don't play them the big finished produced version.\n\nLike \"Hey Jude,\" I think I've got that tape somewhere, where I'm going on and on with all these funny words. I remember I played it to John and Yoko and I was saying, \"these words won't be on the finished version.\" Some of the words were \"the movement you need is on your shoulder,\" and John was saying, \"It's great! 'The movement you need is on your shoulder.' \" I'm saying, \"It's crazy, it doesn't make any sense at all.\" He's saying, \"Sure it does, it's great.\" I'm always saying that, by the way, that's me, I'm always never sure if it's good enough. That's me, you know.\n\nSo when McCartney came along I had all these rough things and I liked them all and thought, well, they're rough, but they've got that certain kind of thing about them, so we'll leave it and just put it out. It's not an album which was really sweated over, and yet now I find it's a lot of people's favorite. They think it's great to hear the kids screaming and the door opening, it's lovely.\n\nThe first of your albums with some of those little bitsy things was 'Let It Be.' Had you wanted to do that before?\nYes, I think so. In the back of everyone's mind there was always that kind of thing. The sound of a tape being spooled back is an interesting sound. If you're working in a recording studio, you hear it all the time and get used to it. You don't think anything of it. But when the man switches on the tape machine in the middle of a track and you hear that kind of djeeoww, and then \u2013 the track starts, I'd always liked all that, all those rough edges and loose ends. It gives it a kind of live excitement.\n\nWhen you do have rough edges on an album, you're open to interpretation. There's the famous example of John and Yoko's 'Wedding Album,' where the reviewer reviewed the tone on the test pressing and said that the subtle fluctuations in this tone were very arty.\nThe whole analysis business is a funny business, it's almost like creating history before it's been created. When a thing happens you immediately start analyzing it as if it was 50 years ago, as if it was King Henry VIII who said it. It is daft, actually, but you can't blame anyone for doing it, they've got to write something. Unless they can say \"I was around at his house and he gave me a nice cup of tea ... funny little blue cups he gave it in ...\" they've got to say, well, what did you mean by this, or what was that tone.\n\nWith one song you mentioned just a few minutes ago, \"Hey Jude,\" everyone was trying to figure out who Jude was.\nI happened to be driving out to see Cynthia Lennon. I think it was just after John and she had broken up, and I was quite mates with Julian [their son]. He's a nice kid, Julian. And I was going out in me car just vaguely singing this song, and it was like \"Hey Jules.\" I don't know why, \"Hey Jules.\" It was just this thing, you know, \"Don't make it bad/ Take a sad song ...\" And then I just thought a better name was Jude. A bit more country & western for me.\n\nOnce you get analyzing something and looking into it, things do begin to appear and things do begin to tie in. Because everything ties in, and what you get depends on your approach to it. You look at everything with a black attitude and it's all black.\n\nThis other idea of Paul Is Dead. That was on for a while. I had just turned up at a photo session and it was at the time when Linda and I were just beginning to knock around with each other steadily. It was a hot day in London, a really nice hot day, and I think I wore sandals. I only had to walk around the corner to the crossing because I lived pretty nearby. I had me sandals on and for the photo session I thought I'll take my sandals off.\n\nLinda: No, you were barefoot.\n\nPaul: Oh, I was barefoot. Yeah, that's it. You know, so what? Barefoot, nice warm day, I didn't feel like wearing shoes. So I went around to the photo session and showed me bare feet. Of course when that comes out and people start looking at it they say, \"Why has he got no shoes on? He's never done that before.\" OK, you've never seen me do it before, but, in actual fact, it's just me with my shoes off. Turns out to be some old Mafia sign of death or something.\n\nThen the this-little-bit-if-you-play-it-backwards stuff. As I say, nine times out of ten it's really nothing. Take the end of Sgt. Pepper, that backward thing, \"We'll fuck you like Supermen.\" Some fans came around to my door giggling. I said, \"Hello, what do you want?\" They said, \"Is it true, that bit at the end? Is it true? It says 'We'll fuck you like Supermen.'\" I said, \"No, you're kidding. I haven't heard it, but I'll play it.\" It was just some piece of conversation that was recorded and turned backwards. But I went inside after I'd seen them and played it studiously, turned it backwards with my thumb against the motor, turned the motor off and did it backwards. And there it was, sure as anything, plain as anything. \"We'll fuck you like Supermen.\" I thought, Jesus, what can you do?\n\nAnd then there was \"I buried Paul.\"\nThat wasn't \"I buried Paul\" at all, that was John saying \"cranberry sauce.\" It was the end of \"Strawberry Fields.\" That's John's humor. John would say something totally out of synch, like \"cranberry sauce.\" If you don't realize that John's apt to say \"cranberry sauce\" when he feels like it, then you start to hear a funny little word there, and you think \"Aha!\"\n\nWhen you were alive and presumed dead, what did you think?\nSomeone from the office rang me up and said, \"Look, Paul, you're dead.\" And I said, \"Oh, I don't agree with that.\" And they said, \"Look, what are you going to do about it? It's a big thing breaking in America. You're dead.\" And so I said leave it, just let them say it. It'll probably be the best publicity we've ever had and I won't have to do a thing except stay alive. So I managed to stay alive through it.\n\nA couple of people came up and said, \"Can I photograph you to prove you're not dead?\" Coincidentally, around about that time, I was playing down a lot of the old Beatle image and getting a bit more to what I felt was me, letting me beard grow and not being so hung up on keeping fresh and clean. I looked different, more laid back, and so I had people coming up saying \"You're not him!\" And I was beginning to think, \"I am, you know, but I know what you mean. I don't look like him, but believe me.\"\n\nYou were supposedly Billy Shears, according to one of the theories.\nRingo's Billy Shears. Definitely. That was just in the production of Sgt. Pepper. It just happened to turn out that we dreamed up Billy Shears. It was a rhyme for \"years\" ... \"band you've known for all these years ... and here he is, the one and only Billy Shears.\" We thought, that's a great little name, it's an Eleanor-Rigby-type name, a nice atmospheric name, and it was leading into Ringo's track. So as far as we were concerned it was purely and simply a device to get the next song in.\n\n\nYour two big television shows were the James Paul McCartney and The Magical Mystery Tour shows. How were these conceived?\nThe Mystery show was conceived way back in Los Angeles. On the plane. You know they give you those big menus and I had a pen and everything and started drawing on this menu and I had this idea. In England they have these things called Mystery tours. And you go on them and you pay so much and you don't know where you're going. So the idea was to have this little thing advertised in the shop windows somewhere called Magical Mystery Tours. Someone goes in and buys a ticket and rather than just being the kind of normal publicity hype of magical ... well, it never is magical, really ... the idea of the show was that it was actually a magical run \u2013 a real magical trip.\n\nI did a few little sketches myself and everyone else thought up a couple of little things. John thought of a little thing and George thought of a scene and we just kind of built it up. Then we hired a coach and picked actors out of an actor's directory and we just got them all along with the coach and we said, \"OK, act.\" An off-the-cuff kind of thing.\n\nThe James Paul McCartney show were these people who wanted us to do a TV show and they said they wanted a nice show and said you can do it any way you want. This seemed like a good opportunity, you know, to kinda get on the telly. So that one was just worked up that way. We met the guy when we went to Morocco. We were on holiday then and they came out and we sat around the pool and talked about various ideas and came back to England and did it.\n\nWere you sorry The Magical Mystery Tour was not shown in America?\nAt the time, hey, I thought, \"Oh, blimey,\" but ... eh ... it started out to be one of those kind of things. Like The Wild One, you know, Marlon Brando ... at the time it couldn't be released. The interest in it came later. The interest started to grow, you know. Magical Mystery Show was a bit like that ... well, whatever happened to it ... that's a bit magical itself. Like the Stones' Rock and Roll Circus. You know, what happened to that, you know. I mean, I'd like to see that. So all of those things work out well. You've got to be patient. Everything like that works out well. I think it was a good show. It will have its day, you know.\n\nThere was an interesting reaction to James Paul McCartney. Some people liked some parts and didn't like others.\nI can understand that. You know, I think a lot of people thought we could have done more ... could have done a better show. It was a little bitty [disjointed]. That was a fair comment, but I got a lot of letters from people, you know, just people, old people, from like Red Creek, Minnesota, just saying, \"Hey man, dug the show, you know.\"\n\nYou told me you still ask your friends, \"Is this really good?\" And Linda mentioned that you still get nervous about the work. And so does this mean you watch critical notices very closely?\nNo, I don't like criticism whatever. I don't think I ever liked it when my dad said, I don't like your trousers. But I went through a difficult period where I started to listen to what the newspapers have to say ... about me ... and say, some guy would be sittin' in New York all hung up thinking, \"Well, that's not as good as I woulda wanted.\" And I thought, \"Well, blimey, that's only one guy. I'm not going to take it as gospel.\"\n\nLinda mentioned you \"bounce off\" people. After you left George Martin and the other three, was Linda the only person to bounce your ideas off of?\nFor a while, yes. Oh yes.\n\nDid you miss not having more people? Is there anyone you ask now outside of people in the band?\nSometimes now I mainly bounce off myself. I do that more now, call it what you will \u2013 maturity? Sometimes if a friend is in the studio I'll ask for their opinion and that will make it easier on me. The laugh of all this is I say all this rubbish and it all changes the next day.\n\nI still read the notices and stuff and they're usually bum ones when you're expecting them to be great. Like after Ram, there were a lot of bum notices after Ram. But I keep meetin' people wherever I go, like I met someone skiing. As he skiied past me he said, \"I loved Ram, Paul.\" So that's really what I go by. Just the kind of people who flash by me in life. Just ordinary people and they said they loved it. That's why I go a lot by sales, not just for the commercial thing. Like if a thing sells well, it means a lot of people bought it and liked it.\n\nDoes that mean, then, that you didn't think too much in retrospect of 'Wild Life'? Because of all your albums ...\nNo, ah, I quite liked it. I must say you have to like me to like the record. I mean, if it's just taken cold, I think it wasn't that brilliant as a recording. We did it in about two weeks, the whole thing. And it had been done on that kind of a buzz we'd been hearing about how Dylan had come in and done everything in one take. I think in fact often we never gave the engineer a chance to even set up a balance. There's a couple of real big songs on there, that only freaks or connoisseurs know.\n\nWell, \"Tomorrow.\"\nYeah, \"Tomorrow\" is one of them. It's like, when I'm talking to people about Picasso or something and they say, well, his blue period was his only one that was any good. But for me, if the guy does some great things then even his downer moments are interesting. His lesser moments, rather, because they make up the final picture. Some moments seem less, he was going through kind of a pressure period. You know, you can't live your life without pressure periods. No one I know has.\n\nYou mentioned Dylan sort of being an inspiration for doing 'Wild Life' the way you did it ... He's going on the road, of course, this month.\nWith the Band ...\n\nDoes this in any way motivate you, inspire you?\nNo, not particularly. I mean, I've just been on the road last year, so my being ... doing that just might have inspired him; I don't know, you know. He's a great guy, Dylan; he's a musician, and stuff, and he's a great spirit. Love him, you know.\n\nDo you think he influenced you at all?\nOh, yes. Very heavily.\n\nI think the first time was in \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away.\" That was John's song. Then there was a good deal of influence in the Hard Day's Night and Help! periods. Certain chords, the acoustic bit. We liked him.\n\nWe met him when we came to New York and we were together awhile. He came to one of my sessions when I was doing Ram in New York.\n\nYou mentioned in the studio that you were influenced in a recent session by Marvin Gaye's \"Trouble Man.\" Do you think Fela or someone else might misconstrue this?\nBeing influenced by something and stealing something are two different things. When you hear the track we did and hear Marvin Gaye's you probably would never know they were related. I may be influenced by something, but it's in my head and doesn't necessarily show in the song. \"Here, There and Everywhere\" was supposed to be a Beach Boys song, but you wouldn't have known.\n\n\"Hi Hi Hi\" was the one that brought you back to the Top Ten, after \"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\" and \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" although in Britain they played \"C Moon\" because \"Hi Hi Hi\" was banned by the BBC.\nI thought the \"Hi Hi Hi\" thing could easily be taken as a natural high, could be taken as booze high and everything. It doesn't have to be drugs, you know, so I'd kind of get away with it. Well, the first thing they saw was drugs, so I didn't get away with that, and then I just had some line \"Lie on the bed and get ready for my polygon.\"\n\nThe daft thing about all of that was our publishing company, Northern Songs, owned by Lew Grade, got the lyrics wrong and sent them round to the radio station and it said, \"Get ready for my body gun,\" which is far more suggestive than anything I put. \"Get ready for my polygon,\" watch out baby, I mean it was suggestive, but abstract suggestive, which I thought I'd get away with. Bloody company goes round and makes it much more specific by putting \"body gun.\" Better words, almost.\n\nIt made it anyway in the States.\nYeah, well, the great laugh is when we go live, it makes a great announcement. You can say \"This one was banned!\" and everyone goes \"Hooray!\" The audience love it, you know. \"This next one was banned,\" and then you get raving, because everyone likes to. Everyone's a bit anti-all-that-banning, all that censorship. Our crew, our generation, really doesn't dig that stuff, as I'm sure you know.\n\n\"Helen Wheels\" has done better in America than England, as have many of your records past, back to the old days. Have you ever thought of a reason why?\nThe only thing I can think of is the foreigner syndrome. We're British, and that means something to an American. It's like some Americans who do better over here, like Cassidy and the Osmonds, even Elvis.\n\nIt's been suggested that the Beatles provided something for Americans they had lost with the death of Kennedy \u2013 youth, happiness, freedom from inhibitions. Does that make much sense to you?\nNo, none at all.\n\nIn songwriting technique, how did you compose with John? How did you compose yourself and then with Linda?\nWell, first, I started off on my own. Very early on I met John, and we then, gradually, started to write stuff together. Which didn't mean we wrote everything together. We'd kind of write 80% together and the other 20% for me were things like \"Yesterday\" and for John things like \"Strawberry Fields\" that he'd mainly write on his own. And I did certain stuff on my own. So I've done stuff on my own.\n\nWhen I said how do you compose, I meant actually sitting down and doing it. Did you use guitar, or did you use piano?\nWhen I first started writing songs I started using a guitar. The first one I ever wrote was one called \"My Little Girl\" which is a funny little song, a nice little song, a corny little song based on three chords \u2013 G, G7 and C. A little later we had a piano and I used to bang around on that. I wrote \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" when I was about 16. I wrote the tune for that and I was vaguely thinking then it might come in handy in a musical comedy or something. I didn't know what kind of career I was going to take.\n\nSo I wrote that on piano and from there it's really been a mixture of the both. I just do either, now. Sometimes I've got a guitar in my hands; sometimes I'm sittin' at a piano. It depends whatever instrument I'm at \u2013 I'll compose on it, you know.\n\nDo you start with a title or a line, or what?\nOh, different ways. Every time it's different. \"All My Loving\" \u2013 an old Beatle song, remember that one, folks? \u2013 I wrote that one like a bit of poetry, and then I put a song to it later. Something like \"Yesterday,\" I did the tune first and wrote words to that later. I called that \"Scrambled Egg\" for a long time. I didn't have any words to it. [Paul sings the melody with the words \"scrambled egg ... da da da da ... scrambled egg ...\"] So then I got words to that; so I say, every time is different, really. I like to keep it that way, too; I don't get any set formula. So that each time, I'm pullin' it out of the air.\n\nWhen did you get the idea you were going to bring in a string quartet on \"Scrambled Egg\"?\nFirst of all, I was just playing it through for everyone \u2013 saying, how do you like this song? I played it just me on acoustic, and sang it. And the rest of the Beatles said, \"That's it. Love it.\" So George Martin and I got together and sort of cooked up this idea. I wanted just a small string arrangement. And he said, \"Well, how about your actual string quartet?\" I said great, it sounds great. We sat down at a piano and cooked that one up.\n\nHow would you see George Martin's contributions in those songs in those days?\nGeorge's contribution was quite a big one, actually. The first time he really ever showed that he could see beyond what we were offering him was \"Please Please Me.\" It was originally conceived as a Roy Orbison-type thing, you know. George Martin said, \"Well, we'll put the tempo up.\" He lifted the tempo and we all thought that was much better and that was a big hit. George was in there quite heavily from the beginning.\n\nThe time we got offended, I'll tell you, was one of the reviews, I think about Sgt. Pepper \u2013 one of the reviews said, \"This is George Martin's finest album.\" We got shook; I mean, \"We don't mind him helping us, it's great, it's a great help, but it's not his album, folks, you know.\" And there got to be a little bitterness over that. A bit help, but Christ, if he's goin' to get all the credit ... for the whole album ... [Paul plays with his children.]\n\n\nThe Wings tour in 1972 was the first time you had toured in six years, wasn't it?\nYes.\n\nHad you intended to keep it that long?\nOh, no, no, no. With the Beatles we did a big American tour, and. I think the feeling, mainly from George and John, was, \"Oh, this is getting a little bit uhhh ...\" But I thought, \"No, you can't give up live playing, we'd be crazy to.\" But then we did a concert tour I really hated and I came off stormy and saying, \"Bloody hell, I really agree with you now.\"\n\nWhere was that?\nIn America, somewhere, I can't remember exactly. It was raining and we were playing under some sort of big canopy and everybody felt they were going to get electric shocks and stuff. We were driven off in a big truck afterwards and I remember sitting in the back of the truck saying, bloody hell, they're right, this is stupid.\n\nSo we knew we were going to give up playing but we didn't want to go make some big announcement, that we were giving it all up or anything, so we just kind of cooled it and didn't go out. When anyone asked we'd say, \"Oh, we'll be going out again,\" but we really didn't think we would. So we recorded a lot and stuff and nobody felt the need to go out and play.\n\nAfter six years I just thought it would be good to get out, because live shows are a lot of what it's about. If nothing else, you get out there and see what people want. I remember at the end of the Beatles thinking that it would be good if I just went out with some country & western group. To have a sing every day surely must improve my voice a bit.\n\nWhen you did start to play live again, were you very nervous?\nYes. Very nervous. The main thing I didn't want to face was the torment of five rows of press people with little pads all looking and saying, \"Oh, well, he's not as good as he was.\" So we decided to go out on that university tour, which made me less nervous because it was less of a big deal. We went out on that tour and by the end of that I felt quite ready for something else, and we went to Europe. I was pretty scared on the Europe tour. That was a bit more of a big deal, here he is, ladies and gentlemen, sold all the tickets out ... I had to go on with a band I really didn't know much. We decided not to do any Beatle material, which was a killer, of course, because it meant we had to do an hour of other material, and we didn't have it, then. I didn't have something like \"My Love\" that was sort of mine. I felt like everyone wanted Beatles stuff, so I was pretty nervous on that.\n\nBut by the end of the Europe tour I felt better, and at the end of the British tour I felt good. By the time we did the British tour I knew we could get it easily and that I could get it going. Everyone digs it, and there's enough stuff not to be nervous.\n\nOn the Wings tour the one song you did from the past was \"Long Tall Sally.\"\nThe first time I ever sang on a stage I did \"Long Tall Sally.\" I must have been pretty young, probably 14; I feel like I might have been 11, I don't know. We went to stay with our parents at a holiday camp called Butlins, a branch in Wales. They used to have these talent shows, and one of my cousins-in-law was one of the red coats who had something to do with the entertainment. He called us up on the stage, I had my guitar with me. Looking back on it, it must have been a put-up job, I don't know what I was doing there with my guitar. I probably asked him to get me up or something. I went up with my brother Mike, who had just recovered from breaking his arm and looked all pale. He had his arm in a big sling. We used to do an Everly Brothers number, something like \"Bye Bye Love.\" I think it might have been \"Bye Bye Love,\" in fact. We did that, and then I finished with \"Long Tall Sally.\"\n\nEver since I heard Little Richard's version, I started imitating him. It was just straight imitation, really, which has gradually become my version of it as much as Richard's. I started doing it in one of the classrooms at school, it was just one of the imitations I could do well. I could do Fats Domino, I could do Elvis, I could do a few people. [Smiles.] I still can! \"I'm walking, yes indeed, I'm ...\" [Does Fats Domino impersonation.] \"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.\" [An Elvis impersonation.] That's Elvis.\n\nDid many of those black artists appeal to you in the late Fifties and early Sixties? John did several Motown songs.\nYes, very much. I loved all that stuff. Those were my favorites, definitely.\n\nWhen did you first think you wanted to be in a band?\nI didn't think I wanted to be in one; I wanted to do something in music and my dad gave me a trumpet, for my birthday. I went through trying to learn that. But my mouth used to get too sore. You know, you have to go through a period of gettin' your lip hard. I suddenly realized I wouldn't be able to sing if I played trumpet. So I figured guitar would be better. It was about the time that guitar was beginning to be the instrument. So I went and swapped my trumpet for a guitar and I got that home and couldn't figure out what was wrong and I suddenly decided to turn the strings around and that made a difference and I realized I was left-handed. I started from there, really; that was my first kind of thing, and then once you had a guitar you were then kind of eligible for bands and stuff. But I never thought of myself being in a band.\n\nOne day I went with this friend of mine. His name was Ivan [Vaughn]. And I went up to Woolton, in Liverpool, and there was a village fete on, and John and his friends were playing for the thing. My friend Ivan knew John, who was a neighbor of his. And we met there and John was onstage singing \"Come little darlin', come and go with me...\"\n\nThe Del Vikings' \"Come Go With Me\"?\nBut he never knew the words because he didn't know the record, so he made up his own words, like \"down, down, down, down, to the penitentiary.\" I remember I was impressed. I thought, wow, he's good. That's a good band there. So backstage, back in the church hall later, I was singing a couple of songs I'd known.\n\nI used to know all the words to \"Twenty Flight Rock\" and a few others and it was pretty much in those days to know the words to that. John didn't know the words to many songs. So I was valuable. I wrote up a few words and showed him how to play \"Twenty Flight Rock\" and another one, I think. He played all this stuff and I remember thinking he smelled a bit drunk. Quite a nice chap, but he was still a bit drunk. Anyway, that was my first introduction, and I sang a couple of old things.\n\nI liked their band, and then one of their friends who was in the band, a guy called Pete Shotton who was a friend of John's, saw me cycling up in Woolton one day and said, \"Hey, they said they'd quite like to have you in the band, if you'd like to join.\" I said, \"Oh, yeah, it'd be great.\" We then met up somewhere and I was in the band.\n\nI was originally on guitar. The first thing we had was at a Conservative Club somewhere in Broadway, which is an area of Liverpool, as well as New York. There was a Conservative Club there and I had a big solo, a guitar boogie. I had this big solo and it came to my bit and I blew it. I blew it. Sticky fingers, you know. I couldn't play at all and I got terribly embarrassed. So I goofed that one terribly, so from then on I was on rhythm guitar. Blown out on lead!\n\nWe went to Hamburg, and I had a real cheap guitar, an electric guitar. It finally blew up on me, it finally fell apart in Hamburg. It just wasn't used to being used like that. Then I was on piano for a little while. So I went from bass to lead guitar to rhythm guitar to piano. I used to do a few numbers like Ray Charles' \"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying\" and a couple of Jerry Lee Lewis' like \"High School Confidential.\"\n\nThen Stuart [Sutcliffe] left the group. He was the bass player. He lent me his bass, and I played bass for a few weeks. I used to play it upside down. And he used to have piano strings on it, because you couldn't get bass strings. They were a bit rare, you know, and they cost a lot, too, about \u00a22 for one string. So he would cut these big lengths of piano strings from the piano and wind them on this guitar. So I played that upside down for a while. I'm pretty versatile, I'll give that to myself. I wasn't very good, but I was versatile.\n\nI'm in Hamburg, and I have a little bit of money together, and finally saved enough money to buy myself a Hoffman violin bass. It was my bass, then, that was the one. And I became known for that bass, a lot of kids got them. That was my big pride and joy, because it sounded great.\n\nAnd that was it, basically. The rest you know.\n\nIn America, the anthology album [Beatles 1967-70] and Red Rose Speedway were back to back Number Ones. You were replacing yourself. Did that strike you as odd?\nI thought it was good, rather than odd, because obviously the big hang up after the Beatles broke up was, and really still is, can any of them be as good as the unit? The answer in most people's minds, I think, is \"No. They can't.\" Because the unit was so good.\n\nWere you glad those anthology albums were released for the historical record or to combat the bootleggers?\nThe bootlegging thing was one of the reasons. I didn't take an awful lot of interest in them, actually. I still haven't heard them. I know what's on them because I've heard it all before, you know. I haven't really taken much interest in Beatles stuff of late just because there has been this hangover of Apple and Klein. The whole scene has gone so bloody sick. The four ex-Beatles are totally up to here with it. Everyone wants it solved so everyone can get on with being a bit peaceful with each other.\n\nThere was a lawsuit recently, the three others against Klein.\nOf course I loved that. My God, I hope they win that one. That's great. You see, apart from everything that went down, all the little personal conflicts, the reason why I felt I had to do what I had to do, which ended up specifically as being I had to sue the other three, was that there was no way I could sue Klein on his own, which is what I wanted to do. It took me months to get over the fact. I kept saying, I can't sue the other three, just because it's very hard news to go suing someone you like, and no matter what kind of personal things were going down and John writing songs about me and all that stuff, I still didn't feel like the coolest thing in the world was to go and sue them. But it actually turned out to be the only way to stop Klein, so I had to go and do it.\n\nThen it all started to come out, you know, that Klein had persuaded George \u2013 I don't know how much of this is libelous \u2013\n\nOur lawyers will take out whatever is libelous.\nKlein made his way into George's big songwriting company, which is George's big asset. The main one was the song \"Something,\" that was on Abbey Road. That was kind of George's great big song, George's first big effort, and everyone covered it and it was lovely and made him lots of money that he could give away, which is his thing, you know. It was a great thing for him. Well, it turns out that Klein has got himself into that company. Not only paid 20% [the percentage Klein claimed to have gotten from Abbey Road] \u2013 there's a thought now that he's claiming he owns the company!\n\nIt's those kinds of little weird trips. Now the only good thing I feel is that I wasn't wrong. I would have felt really bad if I was wrong and the guy was really a goodie all along and I'd gone and stuck my big nose in there like the pot calling the kettle black. But it turns out he is the type of man who wants to own it for himself and not the type of man who believes the artist should have it and do what he wants with it, which is what I believe.\n\nHe was once quoted in New York magazine as saying he was going to roast your ass.\nYeah, well, he never did, you know, and that's cool. He wouldn't get near my ass to roast it, anyway. Punk.\nYou mentioned you had to sue the other three to get at Klein. What was Klein doing that made you have to sue?\nBasically, I was being held to my obligations under an old contract. I would have to just sit, lump it, and let him be my manager, which I didn't want.\n\nSo I was told I could sue him. I said, \"Great, I'll sue him.\" Then they said, \"There's one catch, you have to sue Apple\" \u2013 and that meant suing the other three. For two months I sat around thinking, \"I can't do this.\" Not that I didn't see the others. I did, and kept asking them to let me out and they said, \"No, Allen says there would be tax complications.\" I said, \"I don't give a damn about tax considerations, let me go and I'll worry about the tax considerations. I didn't want to be an ABKCO-Managed Industry.\" It was weird. My albums would come out saying \"An ABKCO Company,\" and he wasn't even my manager.\n\nAs it turns out, it was the best thing, because that got the receiver in there and froze the money and gave everybody time to think about it. He's still managed to get $5 million transferred to his own company, five million for management [the exact amount is subject matter of present litigation].\n\nHe has a very special gift for talking his way. He'll use his Playboy interviews, and he'll probably ask for a Rolling Stone interview after mine. Even a murderer has a great line in his own defense. But he's nothing more than a trained New York crook. John said, \"Anyone whose record is as bad as this can't be so bad.\" But that was Lennon-esque crap, which John occasionally did; utter foolishness. Klein had already been convicted on ten counts of income tax. [Criminal docket 66-72 of US District Court, Southern District of New York, shows one Allen Klein found guilty January 29th, 1971, on ten counts of \"unlawfully failing to make & file returns of Federal income taxes and FICA taxes withheld from employees' wages.\" Conviction affirmed on appeal by US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit November 19th, 1971.] Somebody who's been convicted ten times can't be all clean. [Growing more emotional] My back was against the wall. I'm not proud of it. But it had to be done. To him, artists are money. To me, they're more than that.\n\nIf Klein was the big reason for the breakup of Apple, do you think there would have been difficulties anyway without him?\nI think there would have been difficulties. Had the Eastmans come in like I wanted, the others would have feared I was trying to screw everyone for the Eastmans. It would have been a bit hard for the others to swallow, I'm afraid, since the Eastmans were so close to me. But they didn't want to screw anybody, and the way it's turning out they're settling up most of it anyway. Some people say, \"People are all the same in business,\" but they're not.\n\nI think the Apple thing was great. As it turned out, the one thing about business is that it does have to be looked after. If you have paperwork and bills and royalties and accounts and stuff, they all have to be handled very well, or else things get lost and then accountants have great difficulty in making up the final picture for taxes.\n\nApple was together in a lot of other ways. Although he didn't get treated brilliantly at Apple, it was right for James Taylor to make his first record then. I think it was shameful of them to sue him afterwards, but I think that was largely Klein's instigation because of the way he works. He's kind of \"OK, git the bastard. He's left us and he's a success, let's sue him. We got him, we got his contract.\"\n\nBut I still think all the records that came out of it, Billy Preston and James Taylor, Badfinger, Mary Hopkin, all the people we did take on all had very good records. George, even with the Radha Krishna Temple, I think that's great stuff. I don't think you can fault any of the artistic decisions. Looking back on it I think it was really a very successful thing.\n\nThe main downfall is that we were less businessmen and more heads, which was very pleasant and very enjoyable, except there should have been the man in there who would tell us to sign bits of paper. We got a man in who started to say, come on, sign it all over to me, which was the fatal mistake.\n\nJust as I was going to do a radio show interview the other day, just as I was walking in, this feller walked up to me and said, \"Hello, Paul,\" and I thought I'd seen him somewhere before. He looked kind of middle-aged, 50ish, and I thought, \"What's he want with me? Looks a bit dubious.\" He pushed a little bit of paper in me hand, he said, \"I don't want to embarrass you, Paul, I'm sure you know what this is all about, but I've got my job to do.\" A wife and three kids, all that. So I walked on, muttering, looked at the bit of paper and it says \"ABKCO hereby sue you, John, George, Ringo and everything you've ever been connected with,\" in so many words, companies I'd never even heard of. \"Sue you all for the sum of $20 million.\" That is the latest little line.\n\nI'm not trying to be immodest by classing myself with Van Gogh or with the biggies in the artistic world, but it is just a pure continuation of that kind of story. The whole idea of whoever makes the thing not being given the profits of it isn't a new idea. I think it's a joke, trying to sue us for that amount of money. It is just purely that he thinks, in some way, that he owns us. The laugh is that on that whole Klein thing there is one key thing which I luckily never would sign, so I feel a little bit out of that one, I must say.\n\n\nLinda mentioned Lew Grade's claim that she couldn't write.\nThat was an old one. Around that time we had millions of suits flying here, flying there, George wrote the \"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\" about it. I'd kicked it all off originally, having to sue the other three Beatles in the High Court, and that opened Pandora's box. After that everybody just seemed to be suing everybody.\n\nMeanwhile Lew Grade suddenly saw his songwriting concessions, which he'd just paid an awful lot of money for, virtually to get hold of John and I, he suddenly saw that I was now claiming that I was writing half my stuff with Linda, and that if I was writing half of it she was entitled to a pure half of it, no matter whether she was a recognized songwriter or not. I didn't think that was important, I thought that whoever I worked with, no matter what the method of collaboration was, that person, if they did help me on the song, should have a portion of the song for helping me. I think at the time their big organization suddenly thought, \"Hello, they're pulling a fast one, they're trying to get some of the money back,\" whereas in fact, it was the truth. So they slapped vast amounts on us, I can't remember what.\n\nI wrote Sir Lew Grade a long letter saying, \"Don't you think I ought to be able to do this and do that and don't you think I've done enough and don't you think I'm OK, and \u2013 Hey, man, why have you gotta sue me?\" He wrote me back a very rational letter. I can't remember exactly what it said, but it was a very nice letter. He's actually OK, Lew, he's all right.\n\nYou did a TV show for him.\nAfter it, yeah, that's right. All the suits were dropped by then. Bit me tongue ...\n\nWhen was the last time you saw George?\nGeorge? It's been a little while.\n\nHad George invited you to the Bangla Desh benefit?\nGeorge invited me, and I must say it was more than just visa problems. At the time there was the whole Apple thing. When the Beatles broke up, at first I thought, \"Right, broken up, no more messing with any of that.\" George came up and asked if I wanted to play Bangla Desh and I thought, blimey, what's the point? We're just broken up and we're joining up again? It just seemed a bit crazy.\n\nThere were a lot of things that went down then, most of which I've forgotten now. I really felt annoyed \u2013 \"I'm not going to do that if he won't bloody let me out of my contract.\" Something like that. For years there had been problems as to why the other three felt they couldn't just rip up our partnership agreement. I thought it was crazy if we had split up as a band to have this piece of paper still going on. We were all tied into it and I wanted to break it up and they said, \"Tax, you can't.\" Klein was saying, \"You can't do it, lads, you've got to stay together,\" and I think I know why he was saying it. He was telling the others it was tax and it was impossible and stuff.\n\nThere was an awful lot of that, and a lot of what I did around about then was just out of bitterness at all that. I thought, \"This is crazy, no one likes me enough to just let me go, give me my little bit of the proceeds and let me split off.\" It was a little tit-for-tat, if you're not going to do this for me, I'm not going to do that for you. I tend to see the others now just for business. It's a bit daft, actually. That's why I'm so hot to get these business things over with.\n\nYou were hoping to do it today, I gather.\nYeah, there was a little thing ... you see, each time one of us will get hot for a meeting. Say me, I just got me visa and I got all hot for a meeting. I rang John up, and John was keen to do it. He was going to fly in today from L.A. to New York. Great! I was going to be here; John was going to be here. Then I rang Ringo, and Ringo couldn't figure out what we were going to actually say, outside of \"Hi, there.\" And he didn't want to come all the way to New York from England, he was just getting settled for Christmas. So he was a bit down on it, that kind of blew it out. Then I called John and he said he was talking to George and George was having some kind of visa problems. So it's a bit difficult to get the four of us together. But it will happen soon.\n\nLee said that the show you'll do for Phoenix House as part of the arrangement for your visa will be part of a tour.\nThe only thing now, obviously, is that it's dependent on getting a band together. If we can get something together in the early months of 1974, then we're hoping to come to the States, do a nice tour here. The Phoenix House people helped to get me in. It's a good cause. We just went down to see one of their branches in East Harlem, just now. It's fantastic. I wasn't thinking it would be much, I thought it would be a bit depressing. But it's a beautiful place. There's a lot of love in that place. And it's not the kind of a state thing. There's discipline, too, but the discipline comes out of love. That way no one minds the discipline. If you just start off with discipline and nothing else, a lot of the kids find it hard to do it. But they're all very self-supporting now. It's a great place, I must say. Anyone who's in trouble with drugs, pills, junk or whatever, should take a look in the Phoenix House.\n\nWhat was the reaction of the kids when you went in there?\nGreat. We just shook hands. Their choir sang some songs and we went on a little tour of the house. There was a guy telling us about encounter meetings, how he was putting the bathroom in, doing all the plumbing himself \u2013 they're all very proud, because they're all people who almost messed up. They just made it, and most of them look like they can really go on to great strength because of it.\n\nWould you like this to be a big proper tour or small, like your university tour?\nA big proper tour. I think if you're coming to the States, you can't do it funky. I don't think I could, anyway. I think now I'll be ready to do a big concert tour, although I find it hard to imagine at the moment.\n\nNow that you're in New York, I suppose the rumors will start again. There'll be a Beatles reunion of some sort?\nWell, I must say, like as far as getting together as we were, as the Beatles were, I don't think that'll ever happen again. I think now everyone's kind of interested in their little personal things. I kind of like the way we did Band on the Run, the way we did it. Something we've never done before, and it's very interesting. But I do think that I for one am very proud \u2013 although I don't like the word proud, it tends to be \u2013 ex-servicemen have used the word ... if you know what I mean ... \"proud of my country\" ... but I will use the word \u2013 I am proud of the Beatle thing. It was great and I can go along with all the people you meet on the street who say you gave so much happiness to many people. I don't think that's corny. At the time obviously it just passes over; you don't really think they mean it. Oh, yeah, sure, and you shake their hand or whatever.\n\nBut I dig all that like mad now, and I believe that we did bring a real lot of happiness to the times. So I'm very proud of that kind of stuff and consequently I wouldn't like to see my past slagged off. So I would like to see more cooperation.... if things go right, if things keep cool, I'd like to maybe do some work with them; I've got a lot of ideas in my head what I'd like, but I wouldn't like to tell you before I tell them. We couldn't be the Beatles-back-together again, but there might be things, little good ventures we could get together on, mutually helpful to all of us and things people would like to see, anyway.\n\nI wouldn't rule everything out, it's one of those questions I really have to hedge on. But, I mean, I'm ready. Once we settle our business crap \u2013 there was an awfully lot of money made, of course, and none of it came to us, really, in the end. Virtually, that's the story. So I'd kind of like to salvage some of that and see that not everything's ripped off.\n\nThrough all that kind of bitterness I tended to think like John a bit, \"Oh, the Beatles ... naww ... Crap.\" But it really wasn't. I think it was great. So I'd like to see that cooled out and restored to its kind of former greatness, agree that it was a good thing and continue in some kind of way. I don't see gettin' the Beatles back together \u2013 there's certain things we could do quite quietly and still produce some kind of ongoing thing. I don't think you'll ever get anyone to give up all their individual stuff now; everyone's got it going too well now.\n\nWould you consider the Ringo album an example of that type of cooperation?\nYeah, but I think more than that ... I think that's a beginning; that shows what someone can do just if he asks. That's all he did. He just asked us all. So that's what I like, that no one says, \"Naw, you go on and make your own album.\" So if it's that easy then lots of things could be done in the future. And I'd like to see some great things done.\n\nThis story is from the January 31st, 1974 issue of Rolling Stone.\n",

    "text": "\nDuke and Duchess of Cambridge waved goodbye to Paris after their successful two-day tour \nEarlier they cheered on Wales as they played their final Six Nations match\nTo the dismay of the royal couple, France scored in the 100th minute and converted to win 20-18 \nThey also met with victims of Nice and Bataclan terror attacks at military hospital as part of their tour \nNext they visited the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay where they rekindled their love of art in the Impressionists' Gallery  \n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u00a0have bid a fond farewell to Paris after wowing the French people during their two-day Brexit charm offensive.\n\nIn a cheery final message before departing, a Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'What an incredible two days in Paris! Thank you to everyone who made the visit so memorable. Au revoir for now!'\n\nKate was handed a posy of lilac flowers by a pair of schoolchildren before the royal pair headed back home to the UK.\n\nEarlier they endured a nail-biting finish to the Six Nations rugby today when victory was snatched from Wales after twenty minutes of overtime at the Stade de France.\n\nKate looked a picture of elegance in a double breasted Carolina Herrera coat and flashed a beaming smile as she chatted to William when the players entered the pitch.\n\nAs The Dragons took the lead the future Prince of Wales finally looked back in his comfort zone after appearing awkward since he was filmed dancing 'like a dad' in a club in Verbier, Switzerland earlier this week.\n\nBut he looked a bag of nerves as France pushed for the line in the dying seconds and Wales desperately held on in a bid to secure the win. To his dismay, France scored in the 100th minute and converted to win 20-18.\n\nThe couple were watching Wales' final Six Nations game as part of their two-day tour to Paris. This morning they met with war veterans and victims of the Nice and Bataclan terror attacks at the famous Les Invalides military hospital.\n\nThey then visited the Impressionists' gallery at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay before playing rugby with some French youngsters outside the Eiffel Tower. The couple will be flying back to the UK early this evening by private jet.\n\nWhile attending their engagements this morning, the royals were but 10 miles from the scene of a shooting at Paris's\u00a0Orly airport.\n\nBut they are unaffected by the airport's closure as it is understood that the couple had always intended to use a different airport to get home.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess arrived for their first engagement in the centre of the city on time this morning and there was no obvious sign of increased security.\n\nKate was wearing a chic Chanel suit - a choice bound to delight fashionistas - in muted shades of black, grey and burgundy, with her hair loose, courtesy of her personal hairdresser, Amanda Tucker, who is travelling with her.\n\nOn her feet were a favourite pair of block-heeled burgundy Tod shoes, a more practical choice for the Paris cobbles than her normal high heels.\n\nWilliam and Kate were first visiting Les Invalides, an iconic French military hospital in the heart of the city.\n\nThey learnt about the important historic and current roles of the site, in particular its work supporting veterans undergoing rehabilitation programmes.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess also met victims and emergency service teams from the Bataclan and Nice terror attacks.\n\nAmong those they met were Jessica Bambal Akan, 25, who was shot seven times in the leg, hip and back as she dined with friends at La Belle Equipe restaurant in Paris.\n\nThere was also Kevin, a 28-year-old fireman, a concert-goer at the Bataclan, who was shot in the leg. Both have been undergoing rehabilitation at the hospital ever since.\n\nJessica said the encounter meant a great deal to both, who have found it invaluable to speak about their trauma and prove to the public that life goes on.\n\nWilliam told the Bataclan attack survivors: 'We think you are very strong and very brave, you've made amazing progress.'\n\nThe Duchess added she would be keeping an eye out for Jessica's work, after learning she is retraining to work in fashion.\n\nJessica, 25, said: 'At first [after the shooting] I was a bit shy and didn't want to talk about it because of all of the pain and grief.\n\n'But now I want to say we are not only victims, we have lives, we have boyfriends, girlfriends, work. I want to speak about my friend who died to honour him, I want people to remember who he was.'\n\nShe was shot on her birthday as she dined with three female friends outside the restaurant, who all survived the attack. Her friend Victor Munoz, who was inside, was killed with one shot.\n\n'We were very lucky,' she said of her friends outside. 'We all got shot and we all survived.'\n\nThe prince hailed the 'quick-thinking' of her boyfriend, who made a tourniquet for her leg on the scene.\n\n'It's been very difficult,' she said. 'I like to move. I got through this because of my friends, my boyfriend, my family who helped me all the time.'\n\nThe Duchess asked how she had found readjusting to life after the accident.\n\n'You feel like you're in a dream,' Jessica said, adding that she had tried to view her rehabilitation work as a job in the week, and enjoy her weekends as she did before.\n\nShe used her convalescence to learn Italian, and is now hoping to work organising fashion shows, telling the Duchess she had noted her Chanel outfit.\n\n'I was ambitious, I am still ambitious,' she said, speaking in English. 'If I want revenge I must live and work and prove they [the terrorists] can't touch how we live in our great country. It sparked something: I realised you need to live.'\n\nKevin described how he attended a concert at the Bataclan, only to hear shouting and gunfire. They started shouting at the audience and opened fire.\n\n'Anyone who shouted was shot, so I tried to be as quiet as possible. I was hit twice in the leg but lay there and kept quiet.'\n\nOf meeting the Duke and Duchess, he said: 'It was a very positive experience because I was able to speak about this experience and what I went through.\n\n'It feels very important to tell these stories and be listened to.' Asked how his emotional recovery had been, he told the Royal couple: 'It gave me a challenge, I like a challenge.' The Duchess said: 'You're a very brave man.'\n\nThe couple also spent time with the elderly inhabitants of Les Invalides, including one 101-year-old man who escaped the Nazis three times during the Second World War.\n\nThe Duchess was charmed by Colonel Jean Camus, 100, and Chief Petty Officer Georges Zwang, who will turn 102 in May.\n\nBoth reached for her hand to kiss it as they were introduces, prompting a smile from Kate.\n\nCol Camus fought in France in 1939-40, was taken prisoner by the Germans, escpaed, joined the French resistance and escaped twice after being captured by Vichy forces and the Germans.\n\nHe managed to reach London in 1943 and served as an intelligence officer in the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Operations, before returning to France in August 1944 for the end of the war.\n\nAs they were introduced, the Duke exclaimed: 'As escape artist!' The veteran joked: 'I spent most of my life in jail. I could write a book.' The Duke replied: 'You should, it would be a bestseller.'\n\nCol Camus added: 'I didn't expect to live so long, it's a surprise. I'm very glad to see you living and not on pictures as I saw the Queen and Charles. Thank you for listening.'\n\nThe veteran told the couple his wife had been made an MBE but the now suffers from Alzheimer's and could not make the journey to meet them. The Duchess said: 'Please send her our best wishes.'\n\nThey were also introduced to Chief Petty Officer Georges Zwang, who will turn 102 in May, served in the French navy from 1934-1940 and went on the join the Royal Navy. He then joined the Free French Forces and took part in the landing and battle of Provence where he was seriously injured.\n\nCaptain Stephane, from French Special Forces, severely injured during Operation Serval, joined them, along with Mrs Montcorge, 94. She was a lieutenant in the Free French Forces in 1943 in London and was appointed as liaison officer to General Patton commanding the 3rd US Army from June 1944 to the end of the war in 1945.\n\nShe told the Duke and Duchess she had been appointed after studying in the US.\n\nMoving to the prosthetics room, the couple met Sergeant Phillippe, who was training in the French army as a dog handler when he had motorcycle accident in France leaving him with one prosthetic leg.\n\nHe has previously met the Duke, who presented him with medals at the Invictus Games, where he won a gold in the 100m and silver in the 200m in 2014, then a gold in the driving challenge and bronze in the 100m in 2016.\n\nThe Duke said: 'You are a huge inspiration for all the other guys.'\n\nThey also met two servicemen suffering from PTSD, to be known as Kevin and Francis, who discussed their mutual love of football and tonight's rugby match.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, who was wearing a Chanel coat, were greeted by General Ract Madoux, governor of Les Invalides, who introduced them to a short history of the hospital, built in 1670 by Louis XIV for his veterans.\n\nToday, Les Invalides houses around 80 pensioners, with a cutting-edge prosthetic department helping wounded servicemen and women.\n\nWilliam and Kate were also shown an ornate book, explaining how Charles II, king of England, wrote to Louis XIV to ask him to share with him the plan about the creation of the hospital.\n\nIt went on to inspire the foundation of the Royal Chelsea Hospital.\n\nThe Duke of Duchess of Cambridge rekindled their shared love of art today when they visited Paris's iconic Musee D'Orsay.\n\nThe couple first met when they both studied history of art at St Andrew's University in Scotland (although William later switched to geography) and were keen to visit the museum which houses the largest collection of Impressionist masterpieces in the world.\n\nIn a tender moment William and Kate even looked out onto the world's most romantic city through the face of a giant clock.\n\nThe couple toured the gallery on the second day of their two-day visit to Paris.\n\nIt remained open to the public throughout, prompting gasps from tourists who crowded round to take pictures and videos of the royals on their phones.\n\nHome to some of the greatest works of French and European art produced in the 19th and 20th centuries, they had specifically asked to see one some of Claude Monet's most famous paintings including one of his water lilies series, painted in 1904.\n\nThe French impressionist painted around 250 oil paintings of the flower garden at his home in Giverny, which were the main focus of his artistic output during the last 30 years of his life.\n\nThe couple were also shown other Monet masterpieces, including his 1873 work Coquelicots or wild poppies and his 'parasol' paintings from 1886 titled, Essai de figure en plain-air femme a l'umbrelle. They stopped to take a close look at London, Houses of Parliament, which was inspired by Monet's 1871 visit to London when he was struck by the 'effects of fog on the Thames'.\n\nWilliam, 34, asked director Laurence des Cars: 'This is one of his most famous paintings isn't it?'\n\nThe 1904 masterpiece will go on loan to the Tate Britain later this year as part of an exhibition called: 'The Impressionists in London'.\n\nThe couple were also shown Monet's La Rue Montorgueil a Paris, a 1878 painting of a street which the Queen visited during her 2004 tour of France.\n\nArt enthusiast Kate, 35, who graduated with a 2:1 in 2005, asked lots of questions, particularly about Edouard Manet's Olympia, a nude painted in 1863. Seemingly unfazed by the topless scene, William pointed to a black cat in the picture and was told it was a tongue in cheek addition.\n\nAnother painting that caught their eye was Gustave Caillebotte's Raboteurs de Parquet (1875) featuring half-naked men sanding a floor by hand.\n\nA keen photographer, Kate has been patron of the National Portrait Gallery in London since 2012 and is also patron of a charity called The Art Room, which encourages disadvantaged children to express themselves through artistic endeavours.\n\nKate once said: 'I am a firm believer in the power of art to make a difference'.\n\nWilliam, whose father and grandfather are both keen artists, also studied history of art before switching to geography.\n\nIt is thought that Kate's support in convincing him to switch subjects rather than quit university altogether is what first drew them together.\n\nSituated on the left bank of the Seine, the Musee D'Orsay is houses in the former Gare D'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built between 1898 and 1900.\n\nIt holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914 including works by Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cezanne, Gaugin and Van Gogh.\n\nHaving been used as a railway station for more than 80 years, the decision was taken to close it down because its platforms were deemed too short for modern trains. In 1970 permission was granted to demolish the building but after an eight year row it was finally placed on the list of historic monuments and former French president Georges Pompidou gave the go ahead for it to be turned into an art gallery. It opened in 1986, with its original clocks remaining as a reminder of its transport heritage.\n\nA man was shot dead at Paris Orly airport this morning after taking a soldier's gun and fleeing into a shop, taking aim at soldiers.\n\nLess than two hours earlier, three police officers were shot at in a suburb in northern Paris by a gunman during a routine stop-and-search operation.\n\nPolice now believe the shooting in the northern Paris suburb of Stains, which left one officer injured, was carried out by the man who was later killed.\n\nAfter fleeing the scene, the man stole a woman's car at gunpoint.\n",

    "text": "\nThis morning, Kim Kardashian West is a few minutes late to breakfast because she can\u2019t get this gel-mask thing off her face. She\u2019s staying in a room in the upper reaches of the Baccarat Hotel in midtown Manhattan. A room with a giant bed in it, in which she slept, butt to butt, with her four-year-old daughter, North. And in that room she applied a mask \u2014 of the cosmetic variety, not the Halloween variety \u2014 only to discover she couldn\u2019t really get it off. Where did she get this gold gel-mask thing that\u2019s supposed to make your skin healthier? Man, when you\u2019re Kim Kardashian West, you don\u2019t know where everything comes from. People just give you stuff. The vaults and doors and express-delivery accounts of the world open and a free flow of stuff just washes over you. Kim tries to enjoy it, because that\u2019s the enlightened thing to do. But right now she\u2019s upstairs in her room trying to separate her face from the free gel-mask thing.\n\nIt is 8 a.m. I wait for her in the sumptuous lobby. Baccarat, for those who do not shop for $10,000 vases, is a French company that makes crystal. And being inside the Baccarat Hotel is like being inside a fine crystal lamp where an urbane French genie who wears Louis Vuitton suits lives. Here\u2019s the kind of place it is: $46 from Le Menu du Petit D\u00e9jeuner at the Petit Salon in the hotel gets you two eggs, potatoes, bacon, juice, and\u2026coffee! There is an actual crown on display on a shelf full of curios and crystals, unless it\u2019s the world\u2019s most bejeweled serving dome.\n\nBut Kim K. does not make me wait too long. Seven minutes after 8, she arrives. She looks somehow naked. Her face, anyway. It is scrubbed clean, I guess from the mask removal. There is a stunning absence of makeup, except for some lip balm that she tells me she got in Iceland. Which is ironic given that the 36-year-old recently launched her own makeup line (it\u2019s called KKW Beauty ). Predictably, she has utterly crushed the stuff-for-your-face market the way she has crushed all other markets. I think part of the reason her facial nudity is so striking is that being simple and unadorned isn\u2019t really her role. Her role is more queen of America . (Married to the king of\u2026hip-hop fashion, intellectual provocation, and possible public-\u00adinsanity performance art?) Queen of Instagram, queen of a certain type of television, queen of relevance. The queen of Calabasas, California! Which, if you don\u2019t know, is the Mount Olympus of our time. Will Smith lives there. And Justin Bieber and Drake and the Rock and the Osbournes. And if you think about who\u2019s the queen of those people, wouldn\u2019t you say Kim Kardashian West?\n\nI know, you\u2019re probably wondering what she was wearing. You\u2019re probably saying to yourself: What did she eat for breakfast? I\u2019m not going to make you wait for it. She wears this cool, Rocky Balboa retro gray cotton hoodie with the 1980 American Olympic team logo on it and gray sweatpants. And she orders scrambled eggs with tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions mixed in, an English muffin, and some English breakfast tea with loads of honey. Did she eat everything? Don\u2019t be afraid to wonder. If you don\u2019t care whether Kim Kardashian West ate her English muffin, you need to go back to Kim Kardashian West school so you can appreciate the wonderful granular gossipyness that\u2019s part of what\u2019s so enjoyable about knowing everything about Kim K. before you come back here with your too-good-to-want-to-know-if-she-eats-her-English-muffin-ness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m, like, the most fit I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d she says. How do you get in shape if you\u2019re Kim K.? The same way you do everything: Instagram. You go and you find \u201cthis bodybuilder on Instagram\u201d and you contact her. You find someone who, as Kim K. tells it, \u201chad an amazing transformation after she had a baby.\u201d And Kim K. happened to be in the market for a really amazing transformation after giving birth. Now Kim\u2019s working out an hour and a half a day.\n\nKim Kardashian West \u2014 I don\u2019t want to scandalize you \u2014 has had her picture taken nearly naked before. For Playboy . And completely nude for Paper, GQ, and W magazines. And that doesn\u2019t even include the original document of her fame, the storied Ray J sex tape. \u201cMy publicist would say to me, \u2018You\u2019re not getting naked. I have to be there,\u2019\u200a\u201d she says. I suggest that if your publicist keeps warning you not to get naked, she must know you\u2019re always in danger of getting naked.\n\nIs there an age limit for the naked photo shoot?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m like, I\u2019m going to tone it down. But then I\u2019m like, Wait, I can\u2019t be doing it in 10 years, so \u2014 I might as well. I don\u2019t know what the age cutoff is.\u201d\n\nWe know everything about Kim Kardashian West. She has shown us everything. Talked about everything. Many times. In different languages. Kim has talked about basketball, and baby poop, and having no idea where pickles come from, and the texture of cardboard, and Kanye, and Caitlyn Jenner , and her sister\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s drug problems. Recently, on her show, we even watched her share the story of how difficult her pregnancy and birthing process was and how she\u2019s looking at some alternatives to carrying her next kid herself. Have you ever considered, besides the solipsism, the bravery in that? You know the unflinching way she takes off her top in front of a camera? Or wears a $75 billion dress? That\u2019s how unflinchingly she talks about the fragility of her own human body. It\u2019s feminist. It\u2019s a PSA. Here, in this glass-enclosed beveled luxury maze, while wealthy French businessmen finish eating their $46 toast, I ask if she\u2019s thought about a third child. And she retains this unblinking steady-state feline eye contact and a sense of self-assurance that could freeze water while she says, \u201cI would like to, but I\u2019ve had lots and lots of complications. I had preeclampsia. And then I also had something called placenta accreta. We\u2019ve explored surrogacy. We\u2019re thinking about it.\u201d\n\nI get the vibe from her that, just as she has the crushing instincts necessary to lay waste to our culture and create an America in her image (or is it that she\u2019s created America\u2019s image?), she also has the instinct to preserve the humanity of her family.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do gifts,\u201d she says when I ask her if she worries about her kids growing up with too much. \u201c[Kanye and I] talk about it all the time, about not getting too much and trying to be as grounded and well rounded as possible.\u201d She holds herself to the same standard. \u201cI don\u2019t like presents anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just did absolutely nothing [for our anniversary]. We spent two days in Santa Barbara, and we slept.\u201d Then she remembers: \u201cYou know what? I think we went to IHOP. That\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nAnd then she tells me this story. A motherhood story. It\u2019s about the time last year, in Paris, when she was held at gunpoint and bound and robbed in a hotel by masked gunmen. Well, she tells me, she\u2019d been scared to go on that trip. She was afraid of a terrorist attack. She\u2019d never experienced anxiety like that before. She even went to a therapist about it. And North, sensing her mother\u2019s anxiety, wanted to reassure her.\n\n\u201cShe gave me a little plastic treasure box, and she put her little jewels in it \u2014 like fake little plastic jewels \u2014 and she was like, \u2018Mommy, this will keep you safe when you go to Paris.\u2019\u200a\u201d It is something that, despite all the jewels and Calabasas houses and red carpet gowns and original Basquiats and Rolls-Royces and pairs of Yeezy boots she has, penetrates down into the depths of Kim Kardashian West\u2019s humanity, which, at least after spending a few hours with her, I believe is very much there.\n\n\u201cTo have something really sweet like that is more important to me than all the jewelry,\u201d she says. She tells me she takes it everywhere with her.\n\nAround us, European businessmen sign their checks, step into hushed elevators and are whisked to meetings with continental vampires. Kim K. says she\u2019s going to see what North is up to. I\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s weird about seeing her in person, at this phase of her life. And I think it\u2019s that she wears her crown lightly. I guess it\u2019s that she\u2019s chill. Which doesn\u2019t seem like the one word you\u2019d use for Kim K. I guess it\u2019s that she\u2019s really a mom now. She is a beautiful, worldly 36-year-old woman drinking the last of a cup of English breakfast tea before going out into the world to see to her empire, with her four-year-old child at her side, bearing witness to the domination but never expecting, you know, presents.\n\n",

    "text": "\nSinger Jessie J, 24, is in the news because of her sexuality again. But this time, it's not because of something the out and outspoken bi artist has done. Just the opposite. This time, it's because of something an unofficial biographer says she hasn't done. And that thing is: have sex with men.\n\nChloe Govan says that Jessie J is not bisexual -- even though she herself identifies that way -- but is in fact a lesbian. The \"proof,\" according to the biographer, is the \"fact\" that she hasn't dated men since she was 17. That's seven whole years of being only with women. But I'm confused. Does bisexuality come with an expiration date?\n\nHere are some facts that Govan may not be aware of:\n\nAccording to research from the Williams Institute, the leading LGBT demographic research organization in the world, there are twice as many women who identify as bisexual as there are women who identify as lesbian. That means, among women date women, the odds are two to one that a woman is out as bi.\n\nAccording to lesbian professor Dr. Lisa Diamond, one of the leading scholars on women's sexuality, lesbian and bisexual women more often have fluid, complex, varied sexual histories than linear, static ones. Bisexual women -- and lesbians -- may be \"50/50\" (in terms of experiences with men and women), they may have long periods of time being with just one gender, and they may even be life-long monogamists who are only ever with one person of one gender. All of that can fall under the umbrella of women who use the word \"bisexual\" to describe themselves.\n\nAnd according to lesbian professor Dr. Paula Rust, the vast majority of lesbians have had sex with men, both before and after coming out as lesbians.\n\nIn fact, in the lesbian community, it's so widely known that most lesbians sleep with men that there's even a term for the very few who don't: gold-star. A gold-star lesbian is a lesbian who has never been with a man.\n\nSo, if lesbians can -- and do -- sleep with men, and still call themselves lesbians, then why can't a bisexual woman not sleep with men, and still call herself bi?\n\nIf women who identify as bisexual can have enormous variety in their sexual histories, why can't Jessie J be bi?\n\nAnd if there are twice as many bi women as lesbians, why can't Jessie J be bi?\n\nResearch from the Williams Institute also shows that bisexuals tend to be younger than lesbians. Jessie J is 24 years old. Why can't she be bi?\n\nGovan says that Jessie J was forced to say she's bi by music executives, even though she's really a lesbian, because bisexuality would be more appealing to her audience. But according to Dr. Gregory Herek, the leading researcher on stigma, bisexual women are much more stigmatized than lesbians.\n\nResearch also shows that bisexual women are more likely than lesbians -- and straight women -- to be victims of domestic violence. This means that bisexual women are considered less appealing and are more attacked. (All of which is extremely disturbing, and has been the subject of much of my other writing.) My point is: this \"bisexuality will draw a bigger audience\" trope is bullshit.\n\nOne of Jessie J's most famous songs is called \"Do It Like a Dude.\" Around the internet, this song is getting bandied about as further \"proof\" that she's a lesbian. But first of all, why can't bisexual women be masculine, too? And why must lesbians always be? Some of the most masculine women I know are bi, and some of the most feminine ones I know are lesbians.\n\nSecond of all, when you read the lyrics, you see that it's actually a song about a butch woman at a bar who turns on men by being her masculine self. The lyrics say, \"Boom, boom, pour me a beer/ No pretty drinks, I'm a guy out here\" and later, \"Boys, come say what you wanna... Boys, gettin' hot under the collar.\" Why can't that bi? In fact, how is it not bi?\n\nAnd finally, why can't Jessie J be bi just because she says she is? Why is it that when a celebrity comes out as a lesbian, I don't read that she's actually really secretly bi, but was pressured by her handlers to say she's gay, but when someone comes out as bi, I see this kind of thing over and over again? Why is female bisexuality so unbelievable to people, and why must a woman's statement about her own (bi)sexuality be discredited? How hard is it to just take a woman's word for it, when she talks about her (bi)sexuality?\n\nWhy can't Jessie J be bi?\n",

But, before the duo need to return home for work, they've been enjoying their personal time together like any ordinary couple-holding hands and taking pictures with plenty of laughs and scenic sights. \n\nIt's that kind of personal time that the songstress has made a priority as of late. \n\n\"Right now, I'm actually enjoying finding moments for myself,\" she told Today's Sheinelle Jones.\n\n\"I like having a little mystery to where I'm at. I think that makes me feel very empowered, very in control of where I'm at.\"\n\n\"I'm taking time to have a personal life,\" she continued. \"I'm doing things that I love that I'm passionate about, that I care about...it just makes me happy.\"\n\nWhile it's been less than two months since the stars went public with their fling by smooching outside a Los Angeles restaurant in early February, a source tells E!

The couple hopped aboard one of the city's water taxis \u2013 fittingly named Amore \u2013 to arrive at the famed Belmond Hotel Cipriani, where they were hosting a small welcome gathering for friends attending their upcoming wedding.\n\nAlso taking water taxis for the glamorous festivities: Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber (the latter of whom has already made sure the celebrations will be well-stocked with tequila) and Matt Damon and his wife, Luciana.\n\nA bar hall at the Cipriani was set aside for the welcome celebration, where Alamuddin, in a striped silk Dolce & Gabbana dress, and Clooney mingled with guests as they sipped Champagne and Bellinis. On Thursday gardeners at the hotel planted hundreds of white and pink Cyclamen blooms.\n\nOther guests spotted arriving in Venice for the wedding include Clooney's close friends, actors John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Richard Kind and Ellen Barkin; his producing partner, Grant Heslov; and his cousin, NCIS: Los Angeles actor Miguel Ferrer, who RSVP'd very early.\n\nSome family members started celebrating even earlier: Amal's sister, Tala, was spotted dining with a small group of fellow wedding revelers at local restaurant Da Ivo, a longtime Clooney favorite, on Thursday night, followed by drinks at the Cipriani.\n\nThe wedding is already the talk of the town in Venice, a city used to famous visitors (Clooney is a regular at the annual film festival). \"Ever since he admitted he would be marrying in Venice a few weeks ago, everyone wants to be in on it,\" says local Liliana Sermonetta. \"Where are they staying, what are they eating, will they take a gondola ride? It'll be difficult for Clooney to outdo Salma Hayek and Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault's wedding. The whole of Hollywood moved here for three days!\"\n\nThe local government announced that the streets near the foot of the famous Rialto Bridge, in front of Ca'Farsetti, the town hall, are closed on Monday between 12 and 2 p.m. for Clooney's wedding \u2013 likely for a civil ceremony following the weekend celebrations.\n\nBut potential gondola gridlock aside, Venetians are happy to host the famous couple. \"We are glad that George chose our beautiful city to finally tie the knot,\" says waiter Giorgio Valli. \"We wish him a long and happy marriage to his beautiful wife.\"\n",

As for diet, Sybliss said she believes moderation is the key, and she doesn't sweat her clients about cheating every now and then. \"If Janet feels that she needs to have a chocolate cake, go ahead and have a chocolate cake,\" Sybliss said. \"You're not eating it every day.

    "text": "\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have been married more than a year, so the inevitable pregnancy rumors will begin. According to the latest cover issue of Star Magazine, Jennifer Aniston is 'finally' pregnant at 48 years old.\n\nNow, we've heard in the past that Jennifer Aniston has struggled to get pregnant, even back when she was married to Brad Pitt. In fact, one of the most persistent rumors is that Brad Pitt dumped Jennifer Aniston because she couldn't get pregnant, and he wanted children so badly. The fact that he went on to start a family with Angelina Jolie immediately after their divorce speaks to that rumor.\n\nSo poor single Jennifer struggled for a few years, until she met fellow famewhore-in-chief, Justin Theroux. The two stayed together, against all odds, and even decided to get married. And now, they are reportedly going to start having babies.\n\nSources tell Star, \"It's taken Jen and Justin 16 months of IVF treatments, and they've been through so much heartache along the way, but now it seems their baby dreams have finally come true.\" The source also adds, \"I'm sure they've already planned to throw two baby showers in L.A., one for Jen and one for Justin, since this is his first time being a dad.\"\n\nWell, first \u2013 Jennifer Aniston pregnancy rumors are nothing new. We've heard this time and time again, and this is probably the 400th time that tabloids have come out with a Jennifer Aniston Is Pregnant! Cover. However, we have to question \u2013 could this time actually be true? You can only throw darts at the board for so long before they start sticking to the board, and this might be an instance where the tabloids have guessed about it or so long that it's now coming true.\n\nHowever \u2013 even if Jennifer Aniston is pregnant (and that's a big if) \u2013 it is extremely unlikely that they're planning on throwing two baby showers; that seems excessive, even for them. While a pregnancy would undoubtedly be good news for the couple, they would probably want to keep it undercover \u2013 at least for a little while \u2013 and throwing two big baby showers isn't going to help them keep the news discreet.\n\nOr heck, maybe they want the attention \u2013 they'll be able to use the pregnancy to sell their movies, TV shows, etc. Come back to CDL for all your Jennifer Aniston news and updates. Do you think Jennifer is pregnant this time?\n",

So it's understandable that his mic was at his side Wednesday night when he was supposed to be singing, making it clear that he was lip syncing for at least part of the show.\n\nAnd there were points when he was standing still while his phalanx of 12 dancers were around him.\n\nBut Bieber forgot to sing his most recent No. 1 single \"Love Yourself\" in the middle of his show.\n\n\"I got a little ahead of myself,\" Bieber said, as the stagehands rushed to return the sofa they had already removed as well as tuning his acoustic guitar again. \"Should I skip it?\"\n\nOf course, the capacity crowd screamed \"No!\" And, to his credit, Bieber, a little red-faced, delivered a strong version of the song.\n\nThough Bieber pulled his career out of a tailspin with the recent string of three No. 1 hits from his album \"Purpose,\" his concert at Barclays Center Wednesday night showed that his career rebound hasn't solved all his problems. (Bieber returns to Barclays Center again Thursday, much to the chagrin of New York Islanders fans whose playoff game is delayed until Friday to accommodate the show.)\n\nThe \"Purpose\" tour is quite the spectacle, with its multilevel stage and elaborately choreographed routines. But Bieber ends up being the center of attention and, at times, the weakest link.\n\nHe opens the show in a massive glass box, and in one of the night's best moments, dances in a circular video screen that looks like he's trapped in a cage. No need for college-level performance art classes to figure out what that means.\n\nThe show has its moments. With the upbeat \"Get Used to It\" seeming primed to be his next chart-topper. Bieber looks energized when he's doing flips on a giant trampoline during \"Company.\" And the tropical-tinged dance numbers like \"What Do You Mean?\" and \"Where Are You Now?\" hold up well, giving his faithful fan base plenty to scream about. They want him to succeed and most everyone loves a comeback.\n\nBut before that becomes a secure possibility, Bieber needs to find his \"Purpose\" a little more interesting.\n\nSET LIST: Mark My Words / Where Are \u00dc Now / Get Used to It / I'll Show You / The Feeling / Boyfriend / Untitled / Home to Mama / Love Yourself / Been You / Company / No Sense / Hold Tight / No Pressure / As Long As You Love Me / Drum Solo / Children / Life Is Worth Living / What Do You Mean? / Baby / Purpose // ENCORE: Sorry\n",

    "text": "\nJust days before checking into court-ordered rehab last week, the actress spoke extensively to Piers Morgan in an article for London's Daily Mail newspaper, which published it in this Sunday's edition.\n\nShe's spent more than 250 days in rehab and another trip \"is pointless,\" she said in the Daily Mail story. Instead, she should be allowed to \"go\u00a0abroad to different countries and work with children.\"\n\nLohan's life and career ran off the rails starting in her disastrous year of 2007 when she was twice convicted of drunken driving, once for cocaine use, made three trips to rehab and served an 84-minute jail stay. Her arrests were \"totally irresponsible -- a stupid mistake,\" she said.\n\n\"And from then on, the press were on me all the time,\" Lohan said. \"It was the first time I'd taken drugs. I was out in a club with people I shouldn't have been with, and took cocaine, and got in the car. It was so stupid.\"\n\nHer first rehab visit was not because of drugs or alcohol but to help her deal with the trauma she experienced making a movie, she told Morgan.\n\nShe voluntary checked into the Wonderland Center in Los Angeles while she was shooting \"I Know Who Killed Me\" in January 2007.\n\n\"I was having really bad nightmares, and the movie was pretty traumatizing,\" Lohan said. \"So I stayed in a facility so I could get some sleep and talk about it with someone the next day, because it was overwhelming. But I would leave every day and just sleep there at night. I liked that. It was kind of like having my own live-in therapist, because I was having crazy nightmares and I was having AA meetings on set and stuff. It really helped.\"\n\nShe had been drinking for less than a year at that point, Lohan said. She stayed away from alcohol after her first hangover experience at 17, when her mother made her \"sleep with vomit still on me so I'd understand how it felt,\" she said. \"I was too scared!\"\n\nShe was a good teenager, she said. \"My friends and I would actually pretend to be drunk,\" she said. \"And it was more fun. I never rebelled against my parents -- I worked hard, I was responsible and I didn't go to high-school parties.\"\n\nShe doesn't consider herself to be an alcoholic -- \"I've never woken up in the morning and had a drink\" -- but \"when I was younger, I was definitely going out too much and I was drinking too much.\"\n\nLohan considers herself an expert on rehab facilities.\n\n\"I've been court-ordered to do it six times,\" she said. \"I could write the book on rehab. Constantly sending me to rehab is pointless. The first few times I was court-ordered to rehab, it was like a joke, like killing time.\"\n\nMorgan interviewed her before the confusion erupted over which rehab facility she would enter. After arriving at one -- which California officials said was unlicensed -- she left for the Betty Ford Clinic, where she spent her last and longest rehab stay.\n\n\"I look at it as a good thing,\" she said about this rehab visit. \"I can come back afterwards and be fully focused on work. But I think there are other things I could do instead of going to\u00a0a rehab center that would benefit\u00a0me more. The best thing they could do for me would be to make me go\u00a0abroad to different countries and work with children.\"\n\nIf she is not a drug user -- she tells Morgan she smoked \"some pot\" a year ago -- or an alcoholic, then why would she need rehab, Morgan asked.\n\n\"This is where it gets hard for me to explain,\" she said. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with people taking time to just be by themselves. I think people want to see me do that. They will keep saying the same things about me if I don't. I don't think it will be a bad thing for me to be away with myself for three months.\"\n\nAlthough now confessing to Morgan that she used drugs a year ago, she told Matt Lauer on NBC's \"Today\" show a year ago that that she was \"clean and sober\" then for \"a long time.\"\n\nAlthough she was once arrested for cocaine possession and later sent to rehab when she violated probation by testing positive for the drug, Lohan said she rarely used it since \"I don't like it.\"\n\n\"It reminds me of my dad,\" she said. \"I took it four times in a period from about the age of 20 to 23, and I got caught twice.\"\n\nCocaine made her feel \"a little too buzzed -- it made me feel uncomfortable,\" she told Morgan.\n\nShe's not \"a junkie,\" she said. \"It's the truth. I've never taken heroin either, never injected myself with anything, never done LSD. Those things all scare me.\"\n\nHer drugs of choice are \"pot, obviously, and Ecstasy,\" she said. \"I liked\u00a0that (Ecstasy) better than the others.\" Morgan reports Lohan then giggled.\n\nLohan has previously acknowledged having a drug problem, though. She posted this Twitter message in September 2010 just before entering the Betty Ford Clinic for three months: \"Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away over night. I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps.\"\n\nLohan claimed to Morgan that she's just misunderstood. The constant online tabloid reports of late-night partying, which sometimes results in legal issues, don't show the real person.\n\n\"I've never been a junkie, and never will be,\" she said. \"I just like going out late to clubs with friends and listening to music. Always have done. It's not that unusual for girls of 26!\"\n\nShe slowed down on her drinking on the advice of an actor, Lohan said.\n\nLohan also talked to Morgan about her sexuality -- she's straight despite a past relationship with a woman. \"I like boys,\" she said.\n\n\"I know I'm straight,\" she said. \"I have made out with girls before, and I had a relationship with a girl. But I think I needed to experience that and I think I was looking for something different.\"\n\n\"I like being in a relationship with a guy,\" Lohan said. \"But there's something just different about it with a woman. When I was with Samantha, I didn't want to leave, because I didn't want to be alone. It was very toxic.\"\n\nAbout her father, Michael Lohan: \"He won't change,\" she said. \"I just think there comes a point where you just kind of have to accept what it is.\n\n\"Whenever I do try to bring him back into my life, he creates chaos for me and uses it to his advantage. He's been really good and then really crazy my whole life.\"\n\nWhile she blames the Los Angeles lifestyle for steering her off course, she does point to two Hollywood women who have helped her.\n\n\"Meryl Streep was nice,\" Lohan said. \"She just advised me on my acting and what I needed to do differently, and she told me I needed to go back to live with my mum for a while.\"\n\nShe couldn't move back to New York because at the time, her probation requirements, which including regular drug testing, restricted her to California -- \"the worst possible place I could be,\" she said.\n\n\"Jamie Lee Curtis was very kind to me, too,\" she said. \"She also told me to listen to good advice and to get rid of the hangers-on.\"\n\nWill you see another story about Lindsay Lohan's substance abuse and legal troubles before she's scheduled to get out of rehab in early August? What could happen in the Betty Ford Clinic, a well-respected refuge for those needing to get their lives back on track?\n\nLohan was accused of assaulting a Ford staff member during her last stay in December 2010, although the investigation was suspended on December 24 after the staffer drops charges against Lohan.\n\nJust weeks after her release from there, she was again involved in controversy for stealing a necklace from a jewelry store. It was that shoplifting conviction that put her on the road to her current rehab visit.\n",

After all, Nicole often towers him whenever they are on the red carpet together.\n\nPlus, Nicole has even admitted that Keith doesn\u2019t feel comfortable watching her love scenes with Alexander on \u2018Big Little Lies.\u2019 She said that even though Keith understands that her intimate sex scenes are part of her job, the country singer still watches them with only one eye open.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not surprising that Nicole Kidman would want to work with someone like Alexander Skarsgard. He\u2019s a Hollywood sex symbol. Plus, the characters on \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 often comment on how beautiful Nicole and Alexander\u2019s characters are on the show. Together, they are a perfect couple on the outside, but with plenty of deep dark secrets that no one knows about in the inside.\n\nKnowing how much sex appeal he has, it\u2019s no wonder that Nicole wanted to be paired with him on the small screen. No one else can play a troubled, yet sexy husband, father, and businessman the way Alexander does.\n\nTell us, are you surprised that Nicole Kidman wanted Alexander Skarsgard in \u2018Big Little Lies?\u2019 What do you think of Nicole\u2019s role on the show? Let us know what you think by dropping us a line with your thoughts in our comments section below.

It\u2019s like six degrees of separation with Kevin Bacon, only for influencers with a penchant for fit tea and waist trainers, where\u00a0Scott Disick is the connecting factor.\n\nHere, we prove that theory. After Selena Gomez and the Weeknd dated for about a year, they broke up and she was spotted back with her ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber, almost immediately. Now, it looks like the Weeknd wants revenge, and is using his party monster ways to get it.\u00a0While Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have been attending church twice in one day\u2014apparently, the new couple has a lot to repent for\u2014the Weeknd has been parading models around.\n\nThe Weeknd was caught canoodling with Bieber\u2019s rumored ex, model Yovanna Ventura. He was even spotted holding hands with the model, which is almost as serious as becoming Instagram official.\u00a0According to an Us Weekly source\u00a0who saw The Weeknd in action, \u201cHe was parading her around. He was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the entire night.\u201d\n\nThe potential new couple was snapped at a birthday party in Beverly Hills for French Montana (who dated Khloe Kardashian, whose sister Kourtney Kardashian was rumored to have dated Bieber\u2014and to make everything more confusing, The Weeknd previously dated Bella Hadid, a close friend of the Kardashian/Jenner family). It\u2019s all very Degrassi, only Drake is slightly less involved\u2014although he\u2019s rumored to be hooking up with Hadid and feuding with The Weeknd because of it.\n\nThe Weeknd and Ventura were also seen leaving Hyde nightclub together\u00a0in the back of an SUV, much like Leonardo DiCaprio and his model friend, 19-year-old Juliette Perkins.\u00a0And there\u2019s another Leo link\u2014The Weeknd made sure to stop by\u00a0Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s 43rd birthday\u00a0with model Emily Ratajkowski.\n\nLeo\u2019s birthday was held at the Highlight Room, a rooftop club that opened above the Dream Hollywood hotel in Los Angeles and currently has two stars on Yelp. Of course, there were plenty of models milling about, leaving ample options for The Weeknd\u2014but not all of them had been linked to Bieber in the past.\n\nIt looks like Bieber, Gomez and The Weeknd should all start writing for their next break-up albums\u2026or maybe they can all just collaborate on one.\n",

In anticipation of the arrival of their beloved twins, the singer and her husband Jay-Z have concocted a delivery plan so insane you\u2019d think they\u2019re royalty. On the heels of reports that the famous couple have moved to a rental property close to Los Angeles\u2019 Cedars-Sinai hospital, where Bey\u2019s due to give birth, insiders tell Heat magazine that \u201cthe event is set to be a no-expense-spared extravaganza.\u201d Click through to get the scoop inside Beyonce\u2019s delivery room plans, and how the couple\u2019s daughter, Blue Ivy, will have a very peculiar role in the process.\n\n\u201cBey and Jay want three suites in the hospital- they only had one for Blue. This will give their people space and allow for security, who are needed because people will inevitably try to sneak in and take pictures of the twins,\u201d a source tells the tabloid. Understandably, the duo are \u201cnot taking any chances.\u201d\u00a0BT45tW4A8mR\n\nAnd what\u2019s more is that the famous parents have asked their five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, to help deliver the twins. \u201cBeyonce has decided Blue will be part of the delivery process to make sure she\u2019s not jealous of her new siblings. Blue has her own birth plan written up, and will be staying in the room throughout. She\u2019s set to be the first person to hold the babies after the doctor handing them to Jay-Z.\u201d\u00a0BTrg0rEg9gY\n\nThe insider continues, \u201cBlue\u2019s got $1,200 Givenchy nurse\u2019s outfit, and a notepad to write down the twins\u2019 weights.

They won\u2019t all work at once, but there will always be at least two each around the clock. The cost is a couple of million dollars a year, easily.\u201d\u00a0BSXePJMga6x\n\nWow!

The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival and the movie and actor received a six-minute standing ovation. There is also Oscar buzz surrounding Robert, with some speculating he could receive a Best Actor nomination.\n\nIn the gritty, crime film, Robert portrays a criminal named Connie Nikas, who plans a bank heist with his brother. Robert toned down his usually good looks, to the point of being unrecognizable and at one point, he sported shaggy, bleached blonde hair. The star admitted that he was able to shoot scenes in New York without anyone knowing who he was.\n\nWhen the film premiered recently at Cannes, not only did it receive a standing ovation, there were audible cheers from audience members shouting \u201cBravo\u201d and many came up to Robert to tell him what a great job he had done in the movie. Critics are also raving about the film, which is a departure for Robert, who is used to being ripped by critics and having his films tank at the box office.\n\nOf course everyone knows Robert\u2019s big break came with the 2008 film, \u201cTwilight\u201d where he portrayed broody teenage vampire, Edward Cullen, and continued with the character for a total of four movies. The \u201cTwilight\u201d movies became a billion dollar franchise, making Robert a household name and the object of desire for teenage girls. While he was paid millions to take on the role, it pigeon holed him in Hollywood and almost ruined his career.\n\nFor the past few year, Robert has starred in a string of box office duds, including the sappy, coming of age movie, \u201cRemember Me\u201d and mostly forgettable indie films. Some wondered if he would ever see box office success again, while some were quick to blame his faltering career on the \u201cTwilight Curse\u201d.\n\nSince the ending of the \u201cTwilight\u201d and it\u2019s sequels in 2012, most of the young stars from the movie have failed to see further success. Taylor Lautner was supposed to become the next big action star, but after the box office bomb, \u201cAbduction\u201d, he disappeared from Hollywood for years before returning to the small screen with \u201cScream Queens\u201d.\n\nOther actors from the movie franchise, Nikki Reed, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, and Jackson Rathbone have also had trouble finding success after \u201cTwilight\u201d with each having a box office dud and now most are seen only in the occasional straight-to-DVD movie.\n\nKristen Stewart, who portrayed Bella, has continued to work regularly, although her career suffered a hiccup when it was revealed she had an affair with her married \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman\u201d director.\n\nWith the positive buzz surrounding his latest film, I\u2019m sure Robert Pattinson is glad his \u201cTwilight Curse\u201d appears to be over.\n\n",

The report claims that Kidman is not treating Heard like others on the set. The website's source shares that she has been giving Heard a cold treatment since the pre-production stage. But why?\n\nNational Enquirer claims that it has to do with Heard's divorce with Kidman's dear friend Johnny Depp. \"Nicole didn't like how Amber treated [her friend] Johnny Depp during their divorce,\" the source told the outlet.\n\n\"It doesn't help that [Kidman] has little respect for Amber as an actress,\" or that her role in the movie is \"bigger\" than Kidman's. \"She thinks Amber's getting by on social climbing and good looks rather than talent,\" adds the report. The website's source also added that Heard's \"forceful personality\" will \"guaranteed snap\" when Kidman arrives on set.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop's shares that there is no truth in these claims. Debunking the bogus claim, the website assures that the news is indeed fake.\n\nThe gossip website reached out to the Big Little Lies star and her rep guaranteed that there is no truth in the made claims. They also write that another source from the Aquaman movie sets shares with them that there are no issues between the two actresses.\n\nWhile that has ended the possible speculations, new video shared by Heard show how much she is working out and preparing for her scenes in the movie. In a boomerang video she shared on Instagram, the actress is seen cart-wheeling with her trainer on the sets.\n\nWhereas, Jason Momoa is busy rock climbing as he shares more videos from his training camp.\n\nAquaman is currently being filmed in Gold Coast in Australia and is slated for release on December 21, 2018.\n",

Kris\u00a0wants Kim to get $5 million a year for each year they're married, plus a $20 million bonus if they last five years.\"\n\nKanye's so whipped that he might actually go for this, and you know that five years down the line, Kris is going to make sure Kim will cash in that $20 bonus. Like, her daughter's happiness? Please, she would rather have the $20 million.\n\nAnd although we've discussed Kim's demands, Kanye's supposed demands are even more ridiculous. Star claims that Kanye will include something called a 'classy clause', which will, \"prevent Kim from doing anything to embarrass him during the marriage or the divorce proceedings.\" Well, I wouldn't count on that lasting, especially since there's only so long Kim will contain her inner famewhore during their marriage.\n",

An explosive new interview with\u00a0Matt LeBlanc's\u00a0dad,\u00a0Paul LeBlanc, reveals that the actress actually cheated on her then-husband with her\u00a0Friends co-star long before Brad met Angelina Jolie, 40,\u00a0on the set of\u00a0Mr. and Mrs. Smith!\n\n\"He had fun, that's for sure,\" Paul tells\u00a0Star Magazine of his son's time on\u00a0Friends. \"He even had a relationship with one of the girls...Jen. They would make out in the dressing rooms. He told me about it - it was when she was married to Brad Pitt.\" OH SNAP!\n\nDon't forget, Jen and Matt's characters had a brief fling on the show at the end of Season 9 and beginning of Season 10, so the whole situation is like life imitating art! And considering\u00a0Friends ended in 2004, and Brad and Angelina didn't get together until shortly after that, then, if what Paul's saying is true, it means Jen actually cheated first.\n\nThis shocking claim could totally change the way we think about the Brad/Jen/Angelina love triangle forever, because it would mean that the\u00a0Cake star is no longer an innocent victim. However, Paul also noted in\u00a0Star's interview that he had a falling out with Matt three years ago, and aren't on the best of terms. Do you trust his credibility? \"It is absolutely 100 percent false!\" Jen's rep tells\u00a0HollywoodLife.com. \"Jennifer has never had a romantic or sexual relationship with Matt LeBlanc.\"\n\nEither way, everyone in this whole situation has CLEARLY moved on from whatever happened ten years ago. To everyone's surprise, Brad and Angelina's relationship stayed strong - they have six kids together and were married in Aug. 2014. Meanwhile, Jen has been engaged to\u00a0Justin Theroux since Aug. 2012.\n\nTell us,\u00a0HollywoodLifers: Do you believe Jen cheated on Brad with Matt?\n",

    "text": "\nHis Holiness Pope Benedict XVI announced it through the Vatican, to shock and surprise.\n\nA poised Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands revealed it in a video uploaded to YouTube, and King Juan Carlos of Spain confirmed it by signing a parliamentary bill.\n\nQueen Elizabeth, however, has vowed that abdicate is something she will never do.\n\nAbdication is, after all, a dirty word in the corridors of Royal palaces, especially after the earthquake caused when her uncle Edward VIII quit the throne in 1936 to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.\n\nAnd there is no indication that that will ever change.\n\nYet with the Queen now into her 92nd year, and with the hard-working Duke of Edinburgh choosing to retire last month at the age of 96, plans are afoot which, if implemented, would see Charles appointed King in all but name.\n\nPalace sources have indicated that the Queen has told her inner circle that, if she is still on the throne at the age of 95, she will ask for a piece of legislation called the Regency Act to come into force \u2013 granting her eldest son full power to reign even while she still lives.\n\nI have spoken to a number of high-ranking courtiers who made it clear that preparations for a transition are moving ahead at pace. They have all confirmed that a Regency with Charles taking the lead is now, at the very least, a real possibility.\n\nOne senior former member of the Royal Household said: \u2018Out of the profound respect the Queen holds for the institution of monarchy and its stewardship, Her Majesty would want to make sure that she has done everything she can for her country and her people before she hands over. She is dutiful to her core.\n\n\u2018Her Majesty is mindful of her age and wants to make sure when the time comes, the transition of the Crown is seamless.\n\n\u2018I understand the Queen has given the matter considerable thought and believes that, if she is still alive at 95, she will seriously consider passing the reign to Charles.\u2019\n\nClarence House \u2013 the household of Prince Charles \u2013 is making no comment about Plan Regency, as it has been called. However, it is understood to be a matter of increasingly open discussion at court.\n\nBut Palace staff responsible for communications have been ordered to be \u2018up to speed\u2019 on the 1937 Regency Act, which grants power to the heir apparent \u2018in the event of the incapacity of the Sovereign through illness, and for the performance of certain of the Royal functions in the name and on behalf of the Sovereign in certain other events\u2019.\n\nThe development is all the more significant as it comes against the backdrop of momentous shifts at court \u2013 a series of senior staff changes and departures at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, home to the young Royals.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Private Secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt, 55, resigned his position two weeks ago, sparking turmoil and a \u2018wholesale regime change\u2019 \u2013 as revealed in The Mail on Sunday.\n\nHis shrewd deputy \u2013 former banker, political adviser and television executive Edward Young, 50 \u2013 will replace Sir Christopher after a suitable handover period.\n\nI understand that a number of other high-profile figures \u2013 many loyal to Sir Christopher \u2013 are poised to leave the Royal Households at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace after his unexpected exit.\n\nThey include Assistant Private Secretary Samantha Cohen, the capable former Press Secretary and Sir Christopher\u2019s number three in the private office. Ms Cohen, who is Australian, is said to be a firm favourite with the Queen.\n\nFalklands and Afghanistan veteran, Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, the Master of the Queen\u2019s Household, is also said to be weighing up his position. Sir Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, had been due to retire at the end of this year but decided to depart when Prince Philip stepped back from public duties, leaving the job to his deputy, Sir Michael Stevens.\n\nAt Kensington Palace, the Duchess of Cambridge has hired a new Private Secretary, Catherine Quinn, who is head of the University of Oxford\u2019s Said Business School. It is understood she will take up her new role in October.\n\nPrince William\u2019s Private Secretary, former Ministry of Defence communications expert Miguel Head, and Prince Harry\u2019s Private Secretary, former Blues and Royals Captain Ed Lane Fox, 40, are also said to be considering their options.\n\nPerhaps significantly, there have been no major staff changes at Clarence House, home to Prince Charles.\n\nOf course, the transition to a world in which significantly more Royal duties are undertaken by the younger generations is already well under way. Next month, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will step into their new roles as full-time working Royals, and Prince Harry will be expected to carry out more engagements at his grandmother\u2019s side.\n\n\u2018As ever, the Queen wants there to be the minimum of fuss,\u2019 said the former member of the Royal Household. \u2018Of course, for obvious reasons, abdication is not even a consideration.\u2019\n\nThat is not in doubt. On her 21st birthday in 1947 the then Princess Elizabeth took to the airwaves to make one of her earliest radio broadcasts. Speaking from Cape Town, where she was on tour with her parents and younger sister, it was as unequivocal as it was momentous.\n\n\u2018I can make my solemn act of dedication with a whole Empire listening,\u2019 she said. \u2018I should like to make that dedication now. I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.\u2019\n\nIt was a conviction that she confirmed in her Coronation Oath on June 2, 1953.\n\nWhile it may be acceptable for Queen Beatrix and King Juan Carlos to pass the baton to the next generation, Palace aides still believe the \u2018A word\u2019 is not part of Her Majesty\u2019s vocabulary.\n\nThere is no escaping the passage of time, however, or the fact that the Queen, at 91, is the oldest and longest-serving monarch in the history of these islands \u2013 one who is now without the company of Prince Philip, her consort, on the hundreds of engagements she carries out each year.\n\nThe monarch is in remarkable health, yet courtiers are increasingly aware that there is only so much a nonagenarian, albeit one with incredible stamina, can realistically be expected to achieve.\n\nCharles has already been filling in for his mother, representing the head of state on foreign trips during her Diamond Jubilee year to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nEarlier this year he went in her place to Canada to mark the nation\u2019s 150th anniversary. On a tour of the Persian Gulf, he represented the Crown and was treated like a king with other Royals bowing to him.\n\nMore will no doubt come as the Queen gradually scales back her demanding list of duties.\n\nA Regency, however, would ensure a more formal handover \u2013 and, indeed, the Act was considered in more recent times when the Queen first acceded to the throne.\n\nDocuments show that following the Coronation of 1953, the young Elizabeth II intervened to ensure that Prince Philip \u2013 and not her sister Princess Margaret \u2013 would take over as Regent if she were to die or succumb to illness or mental incapacity before Charles, then aged four, reached adulthood. This was not, of course, required.\n\nTimes have changed, so with the heir apparent fast approaching his 70th birthday next year, what would it mean in practice today?\n\nCertainly, it is not be a decision to be taken lightly.\n\nTo safeguard against a coup, a Regent can only be installed once a decision is taken by at least three of the following: the Sovereign\u2019s consort, in this case the Duke of Edinburgh; the Lord Chancellor, David Lidington; the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow; the Lord Chief Justice, the incoming Sir Ian Burnett; and Master of the Rolls, Sir Terence Etherton.\n\nClarence House and Buckingham Palace officials have played down this speculation, as one would expect. But as one insider told me: \u2018We are in uncharted territory right now \u2013 a monarchy in transition with a clear shift in power.\u2019\n",

She's probably so happy inside, even though she would never admit it for fear of coming across as petty. Think about it \u2013 this is the same man who humiliated her by dumping her for another woman, and now he's the single one while she's happily (or seemingly happily) married. AND he's texting her! It's all her dreams coming true.\n\nAnyway, sources claim that Jennifer and Brad have been casually texting over the past few days, and Brad has been discussing how difficult the divorce has been for him. Apparently, Jennifer has been helping him through this, which is a little suspicious. Being magnanimous, fine, but offering support and advice to an ex-husband that you spent more than a decade getting over? Um... no.\n\nIt's been several months since Angelina Jolie filed for divorce and took their kids with her, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Brad Pitt has been having a tough time since then. He's withdrawn from the spotlight, and we probably wouldn't have seen or heard from him at all if it were not for the fact that he produced Moonlight, one of the most visible films on this year's awards circuit and the eventual winner of this year's Best Picture Oscar.\n\nRegardless, for whatever reasons, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are back in touch \u2013 and how does Angelina Jolie feel about this? Well, apparently, not very happy. Again, not much of a surprise. Angelina may have been the one to call it quits, but that doesn't mean that she's over her ex-husband, the same way he's not over her.\n\nShe didn't leave because she fell out of love with him, she left because of his 'issues', whatever those issues were. And now, to hear that he's talking with his ex-wife, the woman that he left for her?

Miley just happens to be worth about ten times as much as her Aussie beau and because of that, there are reports that she really wants Liam to sign a prenup before they walk down the aisle. Life & Style has reported that Miley's money demands have caused stress in her relationship with Liam, and that the couple is currently fighting about whether or not a prenup is even necessary.\n\nMiley Cyrus is worth a whopping $160 million while Liam boasts just $16 million himself. Life & Style claims that Miley wants to set up a prenup to cover their combined $176 million as they head toward marriage. Apparently, it doesn't matter to Miley if everything about her relationship with Liam seems perfect right now. Cyrus is a shrewd business woman and she knows things can go south very quickly, just like they did in 2013. Miley wants to make sure that her money is safe even if her renewed romance with Liam doesn't stand the test of time.\n\n\"They've had heated arguments over this,\" a source told the magazine. \"He's a firm believer that prenups spoil the romance of a marriage and that if they are truly in love, it's not needed. He's assured Miley he isn't interested in her fortune and has enough money of his own.\"\n\nIt's only fair that Miley ensures that her money is protected with a prenup in the event she does marry Liam. Cyrus is already toning down her over-the-top antics in order to make Hemsworth happy. It was Miley's wild ways that pushed Liam away the first time around. Now that Liam and Miley have grown closer, fans have noticed that her hair has grown much longer and Miley isn't acting out nearly as much as she was in past years.\n\nOn the other hand, Liam has realized that even if she is a little weird, Miley is the woman that he loves. While Miley has toned it down some, Liam is definitely meeting her in the middle and giving the singer some freedom to still express her true self.\n\nAfter reports that Miley moved in with Liam, it looks like she also bought a house of her own. Us Magazine reports that Miley just put $2.5 million down on a 4-bedroom home in Malibu. \"The plan is for Liam to stay there while they reconnect, and then move in permanently when he's ready,\" a source close to Cyrus reportedly told the gossip site. It's unclear why Miley bought the home since it was reported that she was living with Liam, not far away. Now, the pair own a pair of Malibu homes. Could this be their way to get to know each other again without being together 24 hours a day?\n\nSo far, neither Miley nor Liam are talking about their reconciliation. Then again, they aren't hiding their love either. Ever since Miley was spotted in Australia during the New Year's holiday, she and Liam have been seen spending time together. There have even been reports that mutual friend Kellan Lutz congratulated the pair and headlines about Liam purchasing a new ring for Miley. Not to mention that Cyrus was seen sporting her old engagement ring in a few pictures on Instagram already.\n\nWill the prenup continue to be an issue for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth? Fans hope not and many are excited that Miley has her man back. Let's just hope this new Miley is still fun and outrageous, and that Liam doesn't tame the entertainer so much that it hurts her career, if they can even squash the prenup issue and make it to the altar anyway.\n",

    "text": "\nAs Angelina Jolie continues to twist the knife in Brad Pitt's heart amid their impending divorce, the 53-year-old actor is running back to his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston for support, In Touch has exclusively learned. A year after Angelina, 42, blindsided her husband of two years with divorce papers, the actress got candid with The New York Times, seemingly suggesting that her six children are better off without their father.\n\n\"[They're] the best friends I ever had,\" Angelina said of her children Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. \"Nobody in my life has ever stood by me more.\"\n\nAside from shading her ex-husband for his lack of support, Angelina also subtly implied that the kids are doing just fine, even without Brad. \"None of it's easy,\" she continued. \"It's very, very difficult, a very painful situation, and I just want my family healthy. They're getting better.\"\n\nAngelina's public talk of their marriage's demise and smearing of his parenting skills and reputation is enough to send Brad right into the arms of his ex, 48-year-old Friends star Jen. Though she married fellow actor Justin Theroux in 2015, Brad's former wife of nearly five years seems willing to be there for her ex-husband.\n\n\"[He] wants and needs Jen in his life,\" a source tells In Touch exclusively, \"especially during this trying time.\" Justin, 46, isn't worried or the least bit threatened of Jen's friendship with her former beau. \"Brad wouldn't dream of breaking up Jen's marriage,\" the source reveals. \"Brad's leaning on her as a confidante now. His renewed friendship with Jen has been a huge source of support and comfort through the toughest year of his life.\"\n\n\"Overall, Brad and Jen have a great deal in common,\" another source says, \"and have reached a level of closeness and understanding that they never thought was possible.\"But not everyone is comfortable with Brad and Jen's newfound kinship. Angelina has reportedly gotten wind of Brad's new confidante and is none too happy.\n\nBrad Pitt Jennifer Aniston Angelina Jolie Getty Images\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\"She's furious,\" a source reveals of Angelina's reaction. \"Jen's always been Angelina's greatest rival when it comes to Brad. She hates the way that she has always been depicted as the evil femme fatale and Jen as the girl-next-door victim in the famous love triangle.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jen is allegedly reveling in Angelina's sour reaction. \"She's getting her well-deserved revenge,\" says the source. \"Jen feels Angelina lorded her relationship with Brad over her all these years. Jen's having the last laugh. She loves the fact she has become his confidante.\"\n\nExactly how Brad won over Jen as a friend is no real mystery. Earlier this year, he revealed his excessive binge-drinking to GQ \u2014 \"I was boozing too much,\" he said at the time \u2014 and has since decided to quit drinking and issue apologies to all those he wronged. Seeing as Jen \"was the person highest on his apology list,\" as the source says, he called her last June and offered his sincere regrets.\n\n\"Brad flat-out apologized for all the heartache and pain he caused by leaving her for Angelina,\" the source continues. \"He came off as genuinely sorry and Jen was deeply touched. She was completely won over.\"\n\nOne more in-depth conversation was all it took to cement their friendship. Brad opened up to Jen about the infamous plane incident last year in which he allegedly got physical with Maddox while intoxicated. He also got candid about the custody battle that's still ranging on present-day.\n\nBrad Pitt Jennifer Aniston Getty Images\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\"He soberly spoke about hitting rock bottom,\" the source says, \"and how he made the climb out. He launched into a grand apology. He apologized for being an absentee husband in the marriage \u2014 being stoned and bored much of the time. He also made amends for being an avoider, getting lost and in a serious drinking-and-getting-high phase when he fell for Angelina while making Mr. & Mrs. Smith.\"\n\nThe conversations re-instilled Jen's faith in Brad's sensitivity. In 2005, she infamously remarked that Brad was missing \"a sensitivity chip.\" But it seems with these recent, heart-felt dialogues, his chip has been restored in Jen's eyes.\n\n\"He told Jen they might still even be married if he were emotionally and physically present and sober at the time,\" the source says. \"It was the most intimate conversation Brad had ever had with Jen.\"\n\nThe rekindled friendship could even spark some future collaboration. \"Brad wants her involved again,\" says the source, \"and Jen wants in on such prestige projects.\"\n\n\"Jen has a way of calming and encouraging Brad, which he needs in his hectic life right now,\" the source continues. \"He's in a great place mentally and physically. He's in touch with his emotions and his true self like never before. He is closer to the kids than he has been in months, and he's shown tremendous maturity and patience with Angelina concerning the divorce.\"\n",

He and Kim, 36, weren\u2019t bothered by the cryptic messages in the video that the internet consumed themselves with, trying to dissect. However, it was that one very sensitive topic that had the couple upset. As you may know, Kim was robbed of her multi-million dollar, 20-carat engagement ring, at gunpoint in Oct. 2016; as well as other personal items. The traumatic experience caused Kim longterm emotional struggles, which she still deals with to this day.\n\nHowever, she\u2019s admitted that the robbery was \u201cmeant\u201d to happen to her. \u201cI know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,\u201d Kim said through tears on Ellen [April, 2017]. \u201cI know that was so meant to happen to me. I\u2019m such a different person \u2026 I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things.\u201d\n\nIn case [for some reason] you didn\u2019t watch Taylor\u2019s \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d music video, we can help you decode the whole assumed robbery reference. At one point in the extremely cryptic video, Taylor lays in a bathtub, filled with diamonds.\n\nWhen Kim was robbed, she said she was attacked in her Paris apartment and taken to the bathroom after she was tied up and gagged.\n\nThen, Taylor makes a gun-notion with her hand and pretends to cock it back with her hands.\n\nKim was robbed at gunpoint.\n\nLater on in the video, Taylor, along with a group of accomplices, all wearing cat masks and hoodies, are seen viciously tearing through a closet, while stuffing money into bags.\n\nWhen Kim was robbed, she described the scene as French men rummaging through her things, looking for money, jewelry and other lavish belongings of hers.\n\nSo, was Taylor really mocking the traumatic experience Kim endured? You can be the judge of that one. However, we\u2019ve decoded the video [seen above] to give you a clearer look at Tay\u2019s new work.\n\n",

That\u2019s what a lot of fans can\u2019t help but wonder as Kris Jenner was spotted taking care of her children, Mason and Penelope Disick near her family home in Calabasas, California on Wednesday, May 24. Kris took her grandchildren to run errands with her while Kourtney was frolicking with her new boy toy Younes Bendjima.\n\nEyewitnesses say that Kris took Mason and Penelope along with Kim Kardashian\u2019s daughter North West out for frozen yogurt. She\u2019s babysitting her grandchildren while Kourtney and Scott are partying thousands of miles away in Cannes.\n\nA lot of fans can\u2019t help but wonder why Kourtney would still be in Cannes knowing that Scott is there with his new girlfriend Bella Thorne. Apparently, both parents are trying to compete with each other for paparazzi and media attention while their children are back at home.\n\nSure, Kourtney Kardashian loves her children and puts them first in her life \u2013 she\u2019s proven it plenty of times in the past. But is her new romance with Younes Bendjima getting in the way of her parental responsibilities? That might be the case, especially since a lot of people are pointing out that both Kourtney and Scott are acting like children themselves.\n\nKourtney has spent the last week showing off her bikini body and making out with Younes in the South of France. Taking a page out of her book, Scott is now doing the same by partying with Bella. He was even spotted getting very up close and personal with her at their hotel pool in Cannes. Clearly, Scott is trying to make a point by cuddling and making out with the former Disney star in the same town as his ex and baby mama.\n\nSo far Kourtney has not made any comments about her new relationship with Younes Bendjima. But if there\u2019s one thing for certain, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t plan on getting back with Scott Disick anytime soon.\n\nThat chapter is closed, done and in the past. Still, many critics can\u2019t help but wonder if Kourtney might be flaunting her relationship with Younes to make Scott jealous. After all, Scott did it to her several times in the past.\n\nEither way, it doesn\u2019t look like Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick\u2019s drama is going to end anytime soon.

There's a lot to unpack, which has led to both fans and haters speculating that her upcoming album, Reputation, addresses her side of the story.\n\nFrom her tumultuous relationship with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, to the name-calling the singer received lately, you don't have to surf for long to get caught up. But her latest single, \"Call It What You Want,\" is a major departure from her last three releases and suggests a different vibe for her forthcoming album \u2014 and a new beauty look to match.\n\nFrom what we can tell, the overwhelming response to her fourth single is totally positive. Whether she's admitting defeat by apologizing for all the public squabbles that went down last year, or just simply singing about being happy and in love, there's certainly something different here.\n\nThe private videos-turned-music video \u2014 at least that's what it looks like to us \u2014 appear to deliver a look at a more grounded, new Taylor. (She did say the \"old Taylor\" was dead, if you recall.) Naturally, this softer side of the star, seen riding horses and painting, comes with a make-under, too. That is: No red lipstick in sight, no \"Shake It Off\" bob and blunt bangs, and we even spotted her natural curls. According to Twitter, this might be the real image Swift is ready to bring back.\n\nWhether you think this is Swift giving us raw honesty and vulnerability or it's a clever move for redemption, it's hard to deny the pattern we've seen in Hollywood before. Most recently, Miley Cyrus reigned as the queen of the make-under. Alongside her new album Younger Now, Cyrus was featured on multiple magazine covers and her \"Malibu\" music video where her naked face took center stage.\n\nOnly time will tell what this new make-under means the star, but were betting there will be a lot less red lipstick in her future.\n\n",

    "text": "\nFinding a story about Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill isn't exactly a stretch. Last year, Meek Mill's beef with Canadian rapper Drake kept us entertained for months, and Minaj is hardly low-profile. Over the past few years, Minaj has become known almost as well for her social media fights as for her music. As a result, celebrity watchers always seem to have an eye for the next Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj story. In recent weeks, most stories about Mill and Minaj have focused on whether or not hip-hop's power couple are still dating or not.\n\nIn recent days, rumors have emerged claiming that Meek Mill walked into Minaj's dressing room to find her and female rapper Young M.A. in a lesbian tryst. Ace Showbiz has speculated that Meek Mill and Minaj split last month after Meek lost his cool. Mill went on an Instagram rant at Minaj and then deleted his account. The same site reports that MediaTakeOut claims Minaj has become infatuated with female rapper Young M.A. and has split with Meek as a result.\n\nAll Hip-Hop claims that Minaj \"plays for both teams\" and says that she certainly has \"rapped some lines over the years that have suggested that she may be a little bi-sexual or certainly bi-curious.\"\n\nOf course, certain media outlets rarely let the truth get in the way of a good story, and it seems that the latest Mill-Minaj split rumors are just exactly that - rumors with no credible evidence to support them. Indeed, a glance at Minaj's Instagram account suggests that Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj are very much together, as they enjoyed Halloween together. Nicki shared a selection of images with her 67 million followers that showed her having fun with Mill.\n\nGossip Cop reports that the stories claiming Mill and Minaj have split are not only false, they accuse the original source of spreading false stories about the rappers.\n\n\"The webloid's perspective, though, continues to differ from reality. Minaj and Mill are very much still together, as she herself showed on Instagram Monday morning. \"And while the relationship might not last forever, Minaj is not \"dropping\" Mill for Young M.A. MediaTakeOut should probably start looking elsewhere than Twitter and Instagram for its made-up stories.\"\n\nOf course, some might question why Gossip Cop sees itself as the arbiter of truth when it comes to Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill. After all, they seem to rely on the images posted on Minaj's Instagram account as evidence that Meek and Minaj are still an item. One has to wonder if Gossip Cop sees the irony in this, given that they invite another outlet to look beyond Instagram for stories.\n\nMany will wonder why Minaj and Mill do not take legal action against outlets spreading false stories. The truth may lay in Minaj's hunger for publicity. According to Hip-Hop DX, Minaj was recently quoted as saying that Meek Mill's high-profile beefs with the like of Drake are great publicity. Perhaps Minaj believes that all publicity is good publicity.\n\nThe reality is that the public has no right to know anything about Mill and Minaj that the couple doesn't want shared publicly. It is easy to claim that Minaj and Mill gave up their rights to privacy when they entered the entertainment industry. There is no doubt that artists like Minaj and Mill exploit the opportunities for publicity social media affords them. Some claim this makes them \"fair game\" for the gossip columns.\n\nThe reality is that Nicki Minaj's sexuality is her own affair, and she should not be judged or \"slut-shamed\" for it. The inner workings of Minaj's relationship with Meek Mill are no one's business but their own.\n",

    "text": "\nAccording to recent reports and hints dropped by Hollywood sources, Robert Pattinson may have had a secret drinking problem that no one knew about. It would certainly explain why he's been hanging out with Zac Efron, of all people. We already know Zac isn't known for his sobriety, and Rob has been partying quite a lot lately.\n\nStar Magazine's source claims, \"Rob had a hard time adjusting to fame and his breakup with\u00a0Kristen [Stewart], and he turned to alcohol to numb it all.\u00a0He drank a lot every night, and even during filming. But his health was suffering, and he realized his reputation for drinking could cost him plum roles.\"\n\nIs this so hard to believe? Daniel Radcliffe notably had a drinking problem as well, and that was without the public infamy that came with his girlfriend cheating on him in front of the whole world. Clearly, something about all these YA franchises is causing its actors to turn to alcohol, but with Rob's situation, he's always been a social drinker \u2013 maybe a little too much.\n\nHe's admitted to drinking before auditions, and he's usually photographed at bars or parties these days. Even if his vice isn't alcohol, plenty of people have said that Rob's had an issue with substance abuse, even if these allegations haven't technically been proven yet.\n\nAnd trust me, they won't be. Rob's people are very loyal to him and very protective of him, and they won't go to the press with this. And if Star's source is right, then he's already realized that his health and appearance are more important, especially if he wants to continue acting. Alcohol doesn't do the best things to people's faces or bodies, and it's not like Rob has the acting skills to keep him employed without his looks. Sorry Twi-hards, but you know it's true.\n",

Although the relationship is reportedly over, it doesn't look like the two have ended on amicable terms, and things are only beginning to heat up. According to Perez Hilton, Tyga is reportedly planning to release a tell-all book in the wake of his big break-up with Kylie. Insiders close to the \"Make It Nasty\" rapper have dropped a few details about the rumored upcoming book.\n\nBut how would the Keeping Up With the Kardashians matriarch, Kris Jenner, feel about Tyga releasing a shocking tell-all book about Kylie and the Kardashian family? In most cases, close friends of the Kardashian family are locked into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit them from speaking publicly about the family. But apparently, Tyga never signed any form of agreement which would allow him to speak publicly if he desires. A family insider recently shared details about the alleged book.\n\nAlthough Tyga and Kylie Jenner initially tried desperately to conceal their relationship because of Kylie's age, it's no secret he's been in her life for quite some time. Because of that, he's also seen a lot, including how she's evolved over the years. It's quite obvious Kylie's had a number of cosmetic surgeries, but now Tyga reportedly plans to reveal just how many enhancements she's actually had. The insider even insists Tyga was there for many of the surgeries she had.\n\nHowever, that's not all. The insider also claims Tyga has a staggering amount of incriminating details about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for his tell-all book. Since Tyga and Kanye have collaborated on records, he's spent lots of time with the Yeezus rapper and his famous wife. But apparently, all of his interactions with the couple haven't been pleasant. In fact, the insider claims Tyga has enough dirt on the couple to write more than one book. For months now, several rumors have circulated about the famous couple's marital problems, but of course, the rumors have not been confirmed.\n\nReports about Tyga's tell-all book come shortly after their epic break-up on the rapper's 26th birthday. According to People magazine, Kylie Jenner is absolutely furious about her ex-boyfriend's alleged cheating. An insider close to the 18-year-old reality star recently shared details about her reaction to the heart-wrenching breakup.\n\nAlthough the Kardashian women have a history of on-again, off-again relationships, it looks like this may definitely be the end for Tyga and Kylie Jenner.\n\nDo you think Tyga and Kylie Jenner are completely done? If Tyga released a tell-all book, would you read it? Share your thoughts.\n",

We understand if you're a bit embarrassed to admit it.\n\nBut the answer to question number-two is revealed below:\n\nBefore you dismiss this idea as pure nonsense, allow us to direct your attention to David Thorpe's \"Rude Food.\"\n\nIn that cookbook, the late photographer conjures images with subtle juxtapositions of attractive and tastefully nude models, along with an astonishing variety of foodstuffs.\n\nVia Amazon, this allowed him \"to create the ultimate in humerous and safe innuendo.\"\n\nAn anonymous insider tells Radar that\u00a0Kardashian is convinced \"her concept will succeed because she thinks she's in the best shape of her life after having two children.\"\n\nShe does look pretty good at the moment, don't you think?\n\nLast week, The National Enquirer also alleged that Kim was considering a naked cookbook, writing that the wife of Kanye West wanted to show the world her \"generous cupcakes.\"\n\nBy this, we assume the publication meant her \"very large breasts.\"\n\nFor someone who has been out of the spotlight for months, ever since that scary armed robbery in Paris in early October, this would certainly be a way for Kardashian to get the world talking about her once again.\n\nShe could make the talk show rounds.\n\nShe could gain new social media followers.\n\nShe could recapture all the attention lost to sister Kylie Jenner.\n\nWe really don't see any drawbacks.\n\nMoreover, come on... would this really be the most ridiculous idea for a book from a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family?\n\nConsidering the following releases, all of which are 100% real, it may actually be the best.\n",

Instead of respecting the rules, Jay-Z instructed his audience to \u201cDo what thou wilt\u201c.\n\nIt has long been known that Jay-Z is a follower of Aleister Crowley, the English occultist and founder of the Satanic religion Thelema.\n\nThe religion is founded upon the idea that the 20th century marked the beginning of the Aeon of Horus, in which a new ethical code would be followed; \u201cDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\u201c. This statement indicates that adherents, who are known as Thelemites, should seek out and follow their own true path in life, known as their True Will.\n\nJay-Z\u2019s Satanic preaching is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the rapper has shared with the dark side. After starting his career as an aspirational rapper, he reinvented his image as a dark lord, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as he rode to the top of the rap game.\n\nSince establishing himself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, Jay-Z has attempted to tone down his dark image, however the disturbing conversation he held in New Orleans suggests he is far from a reformed character, and he has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.\n\nThe incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.\n",

    "text": "\nIt appears that Justin Bieber's Purpose Tour is on hold and Justin is on vacation with friends. Justin definitely needs some time off after slamming awards shows as fake and hollow.\u00a0The vacation photos started popping up on Justin's Instagram on May 25. Looks as if Justin went camping with an assortment of friends. The singer, who normally writes very little or nothing at all on his social media posts, wrote, \"These are the nights I live for.\"\n\nWhile taking some time off Justin is jet-skiing, maybe doing a little cliff diving and just hanging out. Justin looks pretty relaxed in the photos. On May 27 Justin posted a selfie on Instagram \u2013 he appears to be relaxing by the pool with palm trees in the background.\n\nBut what's going on with the Purpose Tour? Checking out Justin's website all previous concert dates have been removed. You can't tell for certain if Justin scheduled time off or decided at the last minute to take a vacation because he's burned out.\n\nThe first signs that Justin Bieber might need a break came when the singer went on blast telling everyone that just because you buy a CD doesn't mean you are entitled to stop him in the street like he's your bestie. You buy a CD and that's all you're entitled to, a CD, not a piece of Justin.\n\nNext Justin kind of snapped after the Billboard Music Awards saying all these awards shows are all fake, shallow and meaningless. Yet a few days later Justin profusely thanked the Teen Choice Awards for the three nominations he received. Once again, Justin used Instagram to express himself.\n\nThe Purpose Tour resumes on June 11 with several stops in Canada and then through the United States through July 19. After two Tokyo shows in August the tour resumes in Europe in September and runs non-stop through the end of November.\n\nA schedule like that might cause any entertainer to put a tour on hold for a couple of weeks. Hopefully Justin will get some much needed R&R and put all the controversy behind him when the tour resumes.\n\nJustin Bieber was spotted out and about in Los Angeles, California on May 27, 2016. He was wearing a sleeve-less red and blue checkered shirt with cut off sweat pants by FameFlynet\n",

He has not picked it out yet, but he has decided that it is going to be very expensive and have lots of diamonds. He wants this present to be a symbol of his love and commitment to Eniko and their new baby. Kevin asked his assistant to help pick out a super bling ring, necklace, or something classy out for Eniko in the $250k price range. Kevin is determined to prove to Eniko that he loves her and wants their relationship to last.\u201d\n\nAnother insider claimed that Hart has nothing to worry about because while his wife is hurt, she is deep in the third trimester, and has no plans to raise a baby alone.\n\nThe source explained: \u201cEniko is hurt and angry, but she is nowhere near ready to walk away. She simply can\u2018t imagine her life without Kevin. He is her world, and it has been that way since she was 23 years old. Throwing it all away over one mistake is just not something she can do right now.\u201d\n\nThe pal shared that Parrish is focused living a stress-free life and having a healthy baby.\n\nThe friend revealed: \u201cLeaving him is not even a question, she is in her third trimester and already thinking like a mamma bear. Her child\u2019s needs come first. And right now Eniko knows she needs to stay as calm and centered as possible. Breaking up with Kevin right now is only going to put more stress on her.\u201d\n\nSome commenters say that Hart should be honest with himself and start an open marriage if that is not already the case.\n",

'They are having marriage problems.'\n\nIn the tape, Bush can be heard calling actress Arianne Zucker 'hot as s***,' and also saying nothing while Trump makes lewd comments about his co-host Nancy O'Dell.\n\nBut the moment that really angered Davis, a source claims, was when Bush, after gawking at Zucker's legs, asked her if she would give him and the Donald 'a little hug'.\n\n'It wasn't just the vile talk,' the source said. 'It's because he insisted the woman hug him and Trump. It was creepy.'\n\nBush, 45, later released an apology for the interview and said he was 'embarrassed and ashamed', but did not make any mention of Davis.\n\n'I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along,' he said in the statement. 'I'm very sorry.'\n\nThe source said Davis is enraged that Bush 'was stupid enough to put himself in that position' and has now lost what could have been a life-changing gig.\n\n'Billy has brought him on himself,' they said. 'He's blown his big chance at Today and he doesn't have his old job at Access [Hollywood] to fall back on.'\n\n'He fears his career is over. His wife is angered that he has embarrassed her and their daughters.'\n\nBush refused to comment on the article to Page Six, telling the site: 'I cannot take this call.'\n\nDavis has also never released a statement about the incident, but on Saturday she did reappear on her husband's Instagram.\n\nBush returned to social media nearly two weeks after first confirming he was leaving The Today Show, posting a picture of him and Davis in the great outdoors.\n\n'Hiking with lady long legs,' he wrote in the caption. 'Nice to get out.'\n\nIt was the first photo Bush, 45, had shared on Instagram in three weeks.\n\nDavis features prominently in Bush's Instagram, most recently visiting him in New York with their daughters just before the hot mic scandal.\n\n'Teaching the squad about the NYC Subway ONLY way to go,' Bush wrote in one caption, adding that his daughters hated when he said the word 'squad'.\n\nIn another photo him and Davis posted with their daughter on her 18th birthday as she received her first tattoo.\n\nBush, who worked at Access Hollywood for 15 years, had only held his new job at Today for two months when he was given the boot following the Trump scandal.\n\nMatt Lauer confirmed Bush's contract had been terminated 'effective immediately' on an episode of the Today Show last week.\n\nLauer closed out by saying: 'All of us here at Today wish Billy the very best.'\n\nTamron Hall also acknowledged Bush's departure later in the show, saying: 'As a longtime member of the NBC family, we wish Billy all the best as he moves forward.'\n\nBush said in a statement following the announcement that he was 'deeply grateful' for the conversations he'd had with his three teenage daughters.\n\n'I look forward to what lies ahead,' he added.\n\nAlthough speculation has swirled regarding where Bush might go next - including to the rumored future Trump TV - he has not yet confirmed his next step.\n\nInstead it seems Bush has been busy trying to return to life in Los Angeles, even putting up his luxury Manhattan townhouse on the market for $8.2million.\n\nBush had purchased the building for $8.8million just last December.\n\nIt was initially reported that Bush walked away from NBC with $10million, but both his lawyer and additional sources said the figure was inaccurate.\n\nInstead it is believed NBC would only pay some of the remainder of Bush's $3million-a-year contract, according to CNN Money.\n\nExact details of the settlement are not known at this time but sources said the contract does not include a non-compete clause, meaning Bush can look for jobs at rivals stations.\n\nBush's attorney Marshall Grossman spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the interview with Trump, saying that Bush would have been risking his job if he had not laughed at Trump's statements and made lewd comments of his own.\n\n'If Billy had been passive or responded \"Shut the f*** up\" to Trump, Billy would have been out of a job the next day,' said Grossman.\n\nBut one source told the Daily Mail Online that Bush had bragged about the tape while covering the Olympics this summer in Rio.\n\n'What is stunning is how self-important Billy is,' the source said.\n\n'Many people believe Access Hollywood management knew about this for much longer than they are saying and they were protecting Billy while not doing the right thing and informing NBC News.'\n",

A source told OK! that the actor would be interested to portray the Olympian-turned-transgender reality show star. \n\n\"Rob\u2019s been hunting for an awards-caliber movie part. This would be a game-changer for him,\" a source told the magazine. The insider went on saying that Caitlyn had sent Rob a copy of her book and that \"they've met up a few times to discuss it.\" The source added, \"She thinks he's got what it takes to play both her and her former self, Bruce, and now Rob's throwing his weight behind the project as well.\" \n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has learned that the report is simply \"not true.\" A rep for Rob tells the site that \"he hasn't met with the reality star to discuss a potential biopic.\" Caitlyn simply said in an interview that Rob indeed would be a good choice to portray her in a potential film, but the idea hasn't been brought into real life yet. As for the memoir itself, there hasn't been any official announcement whether or not it will be adapted into a movie. \n\nCaitlyn's 320-page memoir \"The Secret of My Life\" was published last April and chronicled her life as well as revealed some intriguing truths about her past. One of them was the claim that her ex-wife Kris Jenner actually knew about her gender issue during their then-marriage. \n\n\"I tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her,\" wrote Caitlyn. \"This will always be a subject of dispute between Kris and me as to how much she could intuit about my gender issues. She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn...I told her I dressed as a woman, and she knew I did, because I did it several times in front of her after we were married,\" she claimed. \n",

    "text": "\nKate Middleton is said to have miscarried. However, a new report claims otherwise. The new report says that it is impossible for Prince George's mom to have miscarried her second baby when she is not keen on getting pregnant anymore and would rather adopt instead. In fact, this is one of the things that Kate and Queen Elizabeth are arguing heatedly about.\n\nThe Aug. 11th print edition of Life & Style Magazine claims that Kate Middleton and Queen Elizabeth are in a serious row. This is not because Kate Middleton lost what could have been the baby sister (reportedly!) of Prince George, but because she does not want to get pregnant again at all. The assumption is that Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles' wife is the only royalty getting on the nerves of Queen Elizabeth, but it seems as if Kate Middleton is rubbing the Queen the wrong way too.\n\nCeleb Dirty Laundry reports that Kate Middleton had it with all the meddling the Queen is doing with her personal affairs, especially on how to raise Prince George and when she should get pregnant again. Even though she originally wanted a lot of kids, having a difficult pregnancy with her first child made her apprehensive and scared about having another baby. Even though she's not entirely closing her doors to another baby, Kate is said to not want to have a second baby just yet.\u00a0 Allegedly, she would rather adopt than have another one!\n\nBecause what the Queen wants, the Queen should get, Kate's attitude is making the Queen see red. \u00a0The idea that an adopted baby will grow up to become royalty is enough to send the Queen to a frenzy. \u00a0Royal tradition would say that only a baby with the royal family's bloodline would be considered \"a spare\" for the throne, so what Kate is suggesting will blow that tradition off. Kate knows this but she also observes that the Queen has not been that inflexible with other things to accommodate the needs of a modern monarchy. She is hoping against hope that the Queen might budge on this one so she does not undergo another difficult pregnancy and she would get to raise a child that is desperate for a good home, Celeb Dirty Laundry reports.\n\nThis is not the first time that Kate Middleton's ways and ideas crossed the Queen. The Life & Style magazine's July 14 feature \"Tormented by the Queen,\" said the Queen flew into rage when she learned of Middleton's plans to move baby Prince George out of London.\n\nKate Middleton just wants to spend more time enjoying Prince George rather than plan another baby though. For this summer, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would change their yearly summer plan of vacationing in the private island of Mystique. With Prince George now in tow, August will be spent a bit differently.\n\n\"The couple will spend the rest of the time off in Norfolk, where the final refurbishments\u00a0are being completed at their new country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate,\"\u00a0shared\u00a0royal family sources with Vanity Fair.\n",

Come what may, their friendship weathers through. It has always seemed that Leah was the only one with a Church of Scientology connection, but that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nIn a recent interview with People, Leah Remini shared how her friend Jennifer Lopez fits into the Scientology equation. While Jennifer isn\u2019t a member of the Church of Scientology herself, her father David is. He has been in the church for over 30 years. When Leah left the Church of Scientology, she was lucky that her husband Angelo Pagan, her daughter Sofia, and her mother Vicky all came with her. A topic she has covered on her A&E Emmy-nominated show, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, is \u201cdisconnecting.\u201d\n\nWhen a member of the Church of Scientology decides to leave the religion, their friends and family that are still in the church are no longer to have contact with them. This is called disconnecting. Now, while the church\u2019s rebuttal is that no one is forced to disconnect and that it is a choice, viewers of her show understand how serious disconnection is taken.\n\nLeah shared that actually, her friend Jennifer Lopez could be in danger of disconnection for remaining her friend. The way the Church of Scientology believes, David Lopez, being an active member, should disconnect from Jennifer because of her continuing connection to Leah. She did imply that it is enforced more for members who are not such \u201cbig names.\u201d Considering she left the Church of Scientology in 2013, it appears there have been no repercussions for their friendship.\n\nThe Church of Scientology took offense to her observations and responded by bashing Leah\u2019s show where she takes on the church. The few times the church has responded to Leah Remini, it has always been to refute all claims their ex-believer has made. They say she is lying, staging the show, and all other ex-members who are on her show are just as dishonest. Leah remains dedicated to exposing the church and the leaders.\n",

Megyn Kelly Today and Live With Kelly and Ryan air during the same time slot (weekdays at 9 a.m.), so it's no surprise there's a ratings battle going on between hosts Megyn Kelly and Kelly Ripa right now!\n\nAccording to Life & Style, the shows were neck and neck with numbers during Megyn's first day in late September. At that time, Megyn very closely beat Kelly and Ryan by 172,000 viewers (2.932 million vs. 2.760 million). The best part for Megyn?

Photos of the TV host all smiles with the unknown woman only fuelled speculations of their separation.\n\nAccording to reports, DeGeneres stepped out with the mystery brunette on June 1. She enjoyed a vegan meal with the mystery woman at Crossroads in West Hollywood. The host seemed to be in a jolly mood as she and her date left the restaurant.\n\nPhotos emerged of the pair leaving the restaurant and walking the street. DeGeneres did not seem perturbed by the attention and at one point even waved at the camera. She also continued to smile for the paparazzi. Meanwhile, the mystery brunette appeared bothered by all the attention and continued to keep her head down. DeGeneres' wife de Rossi was nowhere to be found.\n\nDeGeneres' date supposedly came after she and de Rossi were spotted bickering at each other at a restaurant. The host's cheerful demeanor with her mystery date supposedly also differs from the previous weeks, when she appeared tense with de Rossi.\n\nPhotos of DeGeneres with the mystery brunette only seem to fuel rumors about her divorce with de Rossi. However, the host has since denied these claims. She told People\u00a0in a previous interview that her marriage with de Rossi remains intact. \"I can't imagine not being married. I have my best friend, the person I want to spend time with more than anybody else in the world,\" DeGeneres said.\n\nLikewise, she shut down rumors about her divorce with de Rossi in an interview with Howard Stern on Sirius XM. \"We really don't almost break up, we don't fight, we're madly in love, and I guess it's boring,\" DeGeneres said as quoted by Entertainment Tonight.\n\nDeGeneres also admitted that she does not read the tabloid. She does not pay attention to the divorce rumors surrounding her marriage to de Rossi. This probably explains why she appears cheerful and at ease during her date with the mystery brunette.\n",

If reports are to be believed then Tom might reunite with his daughter Suri.\n\nAccording to reports, the actor wants his 11-year-old daughter back as he misses being with family. Not only that, the actor is all set to marry again. Tom believed that he would not be ready to meet Suri until she goes to college, but after a recent interaction with a reporter, he changed his decision\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0The Mummy actor Tom Cruise opens up about daughter Suri's future as an actress\n\n\"Tom has steered clear of Suri because of Katie and didn't feel he'd be able to come back into Suri's life until she was in college and away from Katie,\" a source close to the Top Gun actor told In Touch magazine. \"But now that he's in hot pursuit of a new wife, he wants Suri back in his life. He misses having a family.\"\n\nTom apparently got inspired to reconnect with his daughter after a reporter asked him Suri's about future. Recently, a reporter asked Tom whether Suri will follow his and Katie Holmes'\u00a0footsteps and enter the entertainment industry. Though he replied, \"You never know,\" the question sparked something in the father.\n\n\"The reporter's question triggered something in Tom and made him want to reconnect with Suri even more,\" the source said, adding, \"It's happening.\"\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has debunked the report and reported that the reunion between the father and the daughter is not happening and the magazine reports are false.\n\nIn March, there were a few reports suggesting that the actor misses being with a family after his mother's death and wants to reconnect with his youngest daughter. However, the father-daughter reunion has not happened until now.\n\nSo, what do you think will Tom Cruise meet his daughter Suri Cruise?\n",

    "text": "\nBeverly Hills| The former drummer of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, surprised the world this morning during an interview in his luxurious Californian residence, when he admitted that the 45-year old rumors about the alleged death of Paul McCartney in 1966 were actually true.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Mr. Starr explained that the \"real\" Paul McCartney had died in a car crash on November 9 1966, after an argument during a Beatles' recording session. To spare the public from grief, the Beatles replaced him with a man named William Shears Campbell, who was\u00a0the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest and who happened to have the same kind of jovial personality as Paul.\n\n\"When Paul died, we\u00a0all\u00a0panicked!\" claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. \"We didn't know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by and\u00a0nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldn't get along with John, at all.\"\n\nWilliam Shears Campbell, better known as Billy Shears, does indeed \"disappear \" from records\u00a0in 1966 and no\u00a0traces of him can be found after Paul's alleged death.\n\nMr. Starr alleges that the group did send out a lot of hidden messages through the years to prepare the population for the truth.\n\nHe notably says that the entire Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album was awash with Paul-is-dead clues: the Beatles had indeed officially\u00a0formed a \"new\" band featuring a \"fictional\" member named Billy Shears, which happened to be the actual name of Paul's replacement.\n\n\"We felt guilty about the deception\" added Ringo Starr. \"We wanted to tell the world the truth, but we were afraid of the reactions it would provoke. We thought the whole planet was going to hate us for all the lies we had told, so we kept lying but sending subtle clues to relieve our cousciousness. When the first rumors finally began about the whole thing, we felt very nervous and started fighting a lot with each other. At some point, it was too much for John and he decided to leave the band.\"\n\nRingo Starr claims that he finally decided to tell the truth, because he was afraid that it was going to die with him. At age 74, he is the only other\u00a0surviving member of the famous band besides Paul McCartney, and he was afraid the deception would never be revealed.\n\nThe rumors of Paul's death began more than 45 years ago, but had always been dismissed as nonsense by the band and its entourage. In September 1969, American college students published a series of articles in which they claimed that clues to McCartney's death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles' recordings. Clue-hunting rapidly\u00a0proved infectious, and within a few weeks, it\u00a0had become an international phenomenon. Rumours only declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in Life magazine in November 1969.\n\nNeither Paul McCartney nor anyone from his entourage have commented Ringo Starr's declaration yet, but the interview has already provoked a lot of reactions around the world. Journalists and paparazzis from around the world have surrounded the residence of the musician only minutes after the interview was broadcasted and are awaiting for the star to comment the allegations.\n\nThe British MI5 also announced an investigation to determine if an impostor could have indeed posed for 48 years as\u00a0the\u00a0Member of the Order of the British Empire,\u00a0Sir James\u00a0Paul McCartney,\u00a0during official ceremonies involving\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II.\n",

    "text": "\nIn July, Jennifer Aniston powerfully spoke out against the constant tabloid pregnancy rumors about her that have circulated through the years, in an op-ed for Huffington Post. \"For the record, I am not pregnant,\" she wrote in it. \"What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment,' and 'celebrity news.'\"\n\n\"If I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing.\"\n\nThe post went viral-but initially, Aniston wasn't even planning on publishing it. She told Ellen DeGeneres this week that she wrote it at first just for herself. \"You know how we kind of write and don't necessarily send it? Or at least when I was a kid I did that. And yeah, I kind of hit a wall. I was pretty raw at the time, just came back from a vacation. My mother sort of-had sort of?-she passed [away],\" Aniston said.\n\nShe and husband Justin Theroux had gone away to the Bahamas in the middle of \"nowhere\". But \"we were mobbed, like a scary kind of mob. Like, I didn't know what was happening. I kept thinking, 'Is Kim Kardashian behind me or something? This is very strange.' And then it turns out that another wonderful photograph, which I've had to sort of live with for the last 10 to 15 years: a picture of me with a bump and a circle around my stomach with an arrow pointing to it. Just in this sort of kind of objectifying way, and I was just fed up with it.\"\n\nShe then poignantly echoed the point she made in her piece: that women are defined by more than just being mothers:\n\nI think these tabloids, all of us, need to take responsibility on what we ingest into our brains. Just because we are women, we have a uterus, we have a vagina, we have ovaries, we need to like, \"Get to work, lady!\" As opposed to, hello, Freedom Medal. We as women do a lot of incredible things in this world other than just procreate-and not that that is not-but it's like we just get boxed in. They love the narrative, they love the story, they love the \"She's jealous of this person, and she's depressed, and oh my god she's never going to have a...\" Whatever the horrible little headline is, we've just got to break out of that and go whoa, whoa. And women, I have to say, are many of the authors of these horrible articles that are written in these B.S. tabloids. So, we have to stop listening to them, we have to stop buying them because we have to support each other, especially at this time, to love each other, to support, and to be proud of women, of whatever your choice is in life. It's up to us what makes us happy and fulfilled.\n",

Casually mentioning a \"special party\" that the fans \"are all invited\" to, the members also slyly hinted at an upcoming reunion.\n\nLater, the members announced that they would be touring the following year, with a special concert slotted for London's historic Hyde Park. Though Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) and Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) have both assured the public that they had no plans to join the other three in the reunion, it seemed like the trio (which rebranded as GEM) was still determined to power forward.\n\nUnfortunately, a pregnancy for Geri put the reunion plans on an indefinite hiatus \u2014 but even after the singer gave birth to her child in January, there was still no word on when the group would get the ball rolling again. Now, according to a report in Page Six, we have official confirmation that the reunion is back in the works thanks to Mel B's impending divorce from her soon-to-be ex-husband Stephen Belafonte.

The actress sat with her legs crossed and staring at her phone, with her foot is resting on one of Jamie\u2019s, while his other foot sneaks around her calf.\n\nFoxx denied reports of romance, insisting the two were \u201cjust friends.\u201d\n\nIn December 2015, Holmes was a guest at Jamie\u2019s surprise birthday party in New York at La Bilboquet restaurant.\n\nAnd soon after, she was spotted at The Honor Bar in Beverly Hills with the actor\u2019s youngest daughter, Annalise.\n\nIn June 2016, there seemed to be the first public confirmation that Foxx and Holmes were, indeed, in a relationship when\u00a0former Real Housewives of Atlanta star Claudia Jordan, a friend, said they were dating.\n\n\u201cHe is very happy with her. I like that he seems very happy,\u201d Claudia said during an interview for the Allegedly podcast.\n\nHowever, Jordan quickly retracted, telling Entertainment Tonight the day after the podcast reveal that she had \u201cno knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen them together. He\u2019s never told me he\u2019s dating her,\u201d she said.\n\nIn April this year, a restaurant customer snapped a photo of them having dinner in New York, and in May they were spotted separately boarding the same private jet at Le Bourget Airport in Paris. They were photographed leaving the Park Hyatt Vendome hotel separately.\n\nTo make it impossible to get photo evidence that they are together, they traveled \u201cin cars with tinted windows and took secret back elevators,\u201d Us Weekly\u00a0reported in April.\n\nThe couple is said to be exhausted by the need for secrecy, and is doubtless thrilled that the long and allegedly controlling shadow of Tom Cruise will no longer be a presence in their lives.\n",

    "text": "\nPhotos of Angelina\u2019s Jolie\u2019s wedding dress have been making the rounds on the celebrity rumors circuit these past few months after an In Touch front page cover claimed Angie got married to a British man just eight months after the split with Brad Pitt. This would be Angelina\u2019s fourth marriage if the tabloid\u2019s article was true, but based upon other reports, it seems safe to say this surprise wedding is likely fake news.\n\nBack in April, In Touch ran a cover story declaring, \u201cAngelina\u2019s Shocking Surprise: Wedding In Cambodia! Marriage No. 4 Just 8 Months After Split With Brad.\u201d The tabloid was running with the idea that Angelina Jolie\u2019s divorce from Brad was being fast-tracked in order to allow a new marriage to a \u201cwealthy, 40-something Brit.\u201d Angelina\u2019s dating of this \u201cphilanthropist business man\u201d was supposedly being \u201cshielded\u201d from the public \u201cby her closest friends.\u201d Worse, Angelina\u2019s children were supposedly out of the loop and had not yet met their new future father figure despite a wedding being planned.\n\n\u201cA quickie wedding would be the ultimate payback [to Brad Pitt],\u201d claimed an unnamed \u201cfamily friend\u201d who is the supposed source for In Touch.\n\nWhile Angelina does have a history of quickly remarrying after her previous divorces, in this case, there are Angelina and Brad\u2019s six kids to consider, making a quick divorce and new marriage very unlikely. In April, Gossip Cop pointed out that \u201cthis tabloid has a proven history of making assumptions and trying to mislead its readers\u201d and an unnamed source of their own claimed that Angie\u2019s 2017 wedding rumors are \u201cbeyond ridiculous.\u201d\n\nIn A Related Report By The Inquisitr\n\nAngelina Jolie\u2019s Children Will Soon Be Living Just Minutes Away From Brad Pitt In Los Feliz, Photo Reveals\n\nIs Brad Pitt Dating? Angelina Jolie Will Reportedly Be Unhappy If He Is\n\nAngelina Jolie\u2019s Kids Are Her Priority, Is She Ready to Co-Parent With Brad Pitt?\n\nAngelina Jolie Relying On Kids To Cheer Her Up After Brad Pitt Split \u2014 Divorce Details Revealed\n\nFast forward in time and In Touch has been doubling down, riding the celebrity rumors train full steam ahead. Now, they are running a cover allegedly showing Angelina Jolie\u2019s wedding in Cambodia. The front cover and the way it features Angelina\u2019s wedding dress are designed to give the impression that Angie has already been married. But if you break open the tabloid, In Touch is claiming Angelina is still planning a future 2017 wedding in Battambang, Cambodia.\n\nThe latest edition is still alleging that Jolie has \u201cquietly fallen for a wealthy 40-something British philanthropist and businessman, and she\u2019s eager to marry for the fourth time as soon as her divorce from Brad is finalized.\u201d The same \u201cfamily friend\u201d is supposedly spilling the beans on the movie star\u2019s plans for a small wedding that celebrates the Cambodian culture. Pitt is supposedly not \u201cstanding in her way anymore.\u201d The funny part is that no one knows the name of Angelina\u2019s dating partner, his age, or any other major life detail.\n\nIn this case, Gossip Cop claims the \u201ctabloid is stepping in it further and further, as the only thing that stinks around here is the magazine\u2019s dreadful reporting.\u201d The real problem is that it\u2019s not merely bad information from an unknown source, Gossip Cop alleges that In Touch \u201chas simply been making it all up\u201d by generating fake news.\n\nWhat is the truth? After all, there have been secret celebrity marriage ceremonies in the past, including well-known names like Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux, Ryan Gosling, and Eva Mendes. In the end, In Touch and its secret \u201cfamily friend\u201d stand alone in reporting Angelina Jolie\u2019s wedding plans, while Gossip Cop has a source claiming that the tabloid has \u201ccreated a soap opera-worthy, but false, narrative.\u201d It seems safe to say this celebrity news is debunked. What do you think?\n",

Of course, with a price tag of $18 million, we're not terribly surprised, but we have a sneaking suspicion she agreed because she feels the need to compete with veteran competitors like ' X Factor ' judge Britney Spears and ' The Voice ' judge Christina Aguilera .\n\nCarey has carried the label \"diva\" with her for years, so the 'Idol' staff is doing the only thing they can at the moment: preparing. Her backstage rider has previously consisted of outrageous demands, so it's no wonder staffers are bracing themselves for Carey's arrival. Let's take a look at some of her previous requests:\n\nDone scratching your head yet? Okay. But the following may be most shocking of all: a source close to the singer said Carey won't require anything out of the ordinary for 'Idol.' Whaaaaaaaaat? \u00a0\"It\u2019s all standard stuff, nothing out of the ordinary,\"\u00a0 said the source. \"It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll need to put a new roof on the building.

Who can think about a frolicking in a mountain of kittens when you have two crying toddlers to take care of? And since the show has \"its own branded requirements for stars to use the products of certain sponsors,\" maybe her demands will be kept at an all-time low!\n",

(Interesting!)\n\nHowever, it seems the Italian label has gone lukewarm on the idea due to Hiddleston's recent publicity-hungry antics with his new girlfriend.\n\nExecutives apparently fear that they will be seen as \"cashing in\" on the drama, something that they are eager to completely disassociate themselves from.\n\nA source shared: \"Tom was on the shortlist as they examined who could take over from Calvin.\"\n\n\"Obviously with Tom now being Taylor's other half and the Calvin past deal, it would generate huge media coverage and headlines.\n\n\"But Armani see themselves as classier than that and think that a rising sports star may suit their current needs better.

With the press corps photographers snapping away, the 46-year-old Slovenia-born stunner smiled for the cameras as the billionaire, 70, awkwardly reached for her hand and clutched the tips of her fingers. \n\n\n\nOnce the obligatory photo op was complete, she, Donald and their 11-year-old son, Barron, boarded Marine One, POTUS' helicopter, which whisked them away to their Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago. Aboard the chopper - and away from the public eye - Melania dropped the act. And Donald's hand. \"Melania,\" a family source alleges in the new issue of Us Weekly, \"does not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is.\"\n\nThat includes the presi\u00addent himself. Multiple sources claim that the former fashion model - who's currently living 200 miles away from Washington, D.C., in NYC's Trump Tower while Barron finishes the school year - refuses to share a bed with Donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city. \"They have separate bedrooms,\" says another Trump insider. \"They never spend the night together - ever.\" (A third source says the couple do sleep in the same room but keep separate beds: \"It's very 'royal' of them!\") \n\n\n\nUpset with the former reality star for trapping her in a life she despises, \"Melania wants as little to do with Donald as possible,\" explains the family source. \"She is not interested in Donald, the presidency or anything involving him.\" A rep for Melania denies the claims telling Us, \"It's unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed 'sources' that have provided fictional accounts.\"\n\n\n\nSince assuming the role of first lady January 20, Melania has kept an extremely limited official schedule. After the inauguration, she mostly stayed in her gilded Fifth Avenue triplex penthouse and didn't set foot in the nation's capital again for 21 days. And the few official appearances she has made were done so begrudgingly. \n\n\n\nMelania escorted Akie Abe, the Japanese prime minister's wife, around Palm Beach in February, but \"only because she was going to be at Mar-a-Lago already,\" according to the family source. \"She refused to do it in Washington.\" \n\n\n\nFor much more on the Trumps, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!\n\n",

It seems that Madonna is a bit more strict at home than one would imagine, and she wants to send son Rocco to military school. Rocco Ritchie, 15, does not want to go, and while on tour with Madonna, he ran off to live with his father.\n\nAccording to the Inquisitr, Madonna says that Guy Ritchie is trash-talking her to Rocco, but Rocco insists that his mother is controlling and uses him as a trophy. Also, rather than being in school in New York, he is dragged along on her tour and put to work. He has had enough and wants to live with his father. This is a struggle that many divorced parents face, but Madonna feels that she is above this and went right to a judge, but Rocco is refusing to come back to the U.S.\n\nRadar Online is reporting that Madonna is taking her controlling manner to a new level by trying to get Rocco into military school.\n\n\"Madonna is a very good mother, but she's mega controlling,\" a source close to the pop icon, 57, told Radar. \"She actively tells him what he can and can't do, who he can and can't talk to.\"\n\nBut Madonna thinks that military school will straighten Rocco out, but Rocco wants a normal life with Guy Ritchie in the U.K.\n\n\"He's not being dragged around like a dancing puppet [when he's in London],\" a source told the publication. \"He can meet his friends, eat fast food, he doesn't have an early curfew. The story is his father manipulated him, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Rocco has a life and friends [in the U.K.] and he can have girlfriends and be in one place.\"\n\nThe judge had ruled that Rocco should be back by Christmas but is now insisting that he is back before school starts in January\n\nThe New York Daily News has mentioned that Madonna is a meddling mama, and Rocco is over it. A source says that life in London is easier for Rocco at this point in his life.\n\nMadonna thinks she can provide a better life for Rocco, and that Guy Ritchie's life is boring.\n\n\"(Madonna) is impossible to work with and impossible to live with for a 15-year-old boy. He has no freedom under her. She tells him he's going away to school,\" says the source. \"His life (in London) is not strict, he's not Madonna's son, he's more like a regular teen. Guy lives a very normal life, Rocco is not on movie sets, if he doesn't want to be there.\"\n\nRocco desperately wants to enroll in school in London and come back to New York in the future to visit. Over the weekend, Rocco was seen skateboarding around the Ritchie neighborhood and simply hanging out with friends.\n\nThere is no indication whether Rocco plans to return to New York for a hearing with the judge or if he will fight it from London with his father.\n\nDo you think it would be best if Madonna would just give Rocco time with his father?\n",

But what went wrong? It appears that the Jenner mother, Kris Jenner, is to be blamed for the spiteful dispute.\n\nAccording to a report by Star, the Jenner sisters and Hadid sisters are at war and Kris Jenner is fuelling the surprising conflict. Apparently, mom-manager has designed a plan to make her daughters, Kendall and Kylie, the next \"it\" girls of the fashion industry by replacing the Hadid siblings.\n\nA source told the gossip website that Kris is \"setting the stage\" for a nasty fight between the young models.

He genuinely thought he was going to get spared.\u201d Well, maybe next time, Tom.\n\nAs soon as Taylor\u2019s sixth studio album dropped, at midnight on Nov. 10, fans instantly began dissecting each and every lyric, as did we! And, here\u2019s what we came up with. The first Tom reference came on her track, \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d, which is actually about two men who made a mark on her 2016 year. The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a \u201cnarcissist\u201d who \u201ctalks sh-t.\u201d Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a \u201cplayboy\u201d who she flew \u201caround the world\u201d with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.\n\nThe second Tom reference on \u201cReputation\u201d came on the track, \u201cGetaway Car\u201d, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesn\u2019t have a \u201creason.\u201d Then, when she goes to an event where \u201cthe ties were black and the lights were white,\u201d she found her reason \u2014 a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Gala\u2026 the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didn\u2019t work out, and that the person [Tom] should\u2019ve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place. And, again, you can decide. For a complete guide to every song and its hidden meaning, check out our full breakdown here.\n\nTaylor and Tom were first linked at the Met Gala in 2016, as mentioned above. They even attended a pre-Met dinner at the home of Vogue\u2018s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, 68. Exactly one month later, she and Calvin split; and, two weeks after that, she and Tom were photographed in Rhode Island together. And, the rest was history, until they split just three months later in Sept. 2016.\n\n\nHollywoodLifers, tell us, do you love Taylor\u2019s new album?\n",

Magazine is reporting that the \"Wildest Dreams\" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.\n\nThe tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.\n\nThe source said, \"Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn't ready for a serious relationship, but now she's showing Jake how much she's matured. She's excited to see where things go.\"\n\nIn 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.\n\nAn unidentified source told Star magazine that, \"He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor's new number. They've kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.\"\n\nThis would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.\n\n\"This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex's and starts talking about how he's heard we're going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together - just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, 'This is what we're writing,'\" she once revealed to GMA.\n\nThe lyrics in the track said: \"I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.\"\n\nIn the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.\n\nSince Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was \"no truth\" to the report.\n\nDo you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.\n",

In fact, new reports indicate that the Hollywood star has just landed a new role in the psychological thriller, 'Underwater.'\n\nAccording to Deadline, the film is about an underwater scientific crew that struggle to survive after an earthquake. Kristen will star as Noah, a woman who ends up in a relationship with another crewmember. And while there have been reports suggesting that Kristen might reunite with her ex-boyfriend Robert Pattinson for another 'Twilight' film, at this point it doesn't look like it's going to happen.\n\nThen again, many fans believe that one of the reasons why there will never be another 'Twilight' movie made again is because Robert Pattinson doesn't want to work with Kristen Stewart again. After all, she absolutely humiliated him right before their break-up in 2012. Robert was devastated when he found out that Kristen was having a secret affair with director Rupert Sanders behind his back. His trust issues with Kristen would make it hard for the two to ever work together again.\n\nPlus, Robert Pattinson has moved on with FKA Twigs. He doesn't want to deal with the tabloid media and even more unnecessary rumors about his personal life. Meanwhile, Kristen is dating model Stella Maxwell. The last thing Robert wants is to be involved in a messy and complicated love triangle with his ex and his current girlfriend. He wants to concentrate on his Hollywood career and not the gossip magazines that write about his love life.\n\nBut for Kristen Stewart, she doesn't feel that way. She loves the attention she gets whenever her name is in the headlines. She even mentioned earlier this month that she would be open to filming another 'Twilight' movie if the script and timing were both right. She even told reporters that she would be the first person to read it, too.\n\nWhat do you think of Kristen's new role in 'Underwater?'

Top knot trouble: Kim displayed the hair loss as she wore her hair up in a high bun while out in Los Angeles last week\n\n\n\n'I would not recommend that Kim keep the weave in her hair, but rather opt for lighter non damaging types of extensions, or a simple clip-in that can be taken out often to relieve pressure on hair follicles and the scalp.'\n\nKim isn't the only star to have suffered after relying on extensions and weaves.\n\nRihanna and Naomi Campbell are among the other famous faces to have found themselves with damaged hair after boosting their barnets with extensions.\n",

Some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended.\n\nOne witness said Grande had just finished her final song and said 'Thank you, Manchester,' before leaving the stage when suddenly there was a loud explosion.\n\nThe incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another.\n\nTaxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free, and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down.\n\nCity officials said the true spirit of Manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident \u00a0while Twitter and Facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for.\n\nThe names of the victims are also slowly becoming public, revealing that most were young female teenagers, no doubt thrilled to be seeing Ariana perform live for the first time.\n\nEight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos is the youngest victim who has been identified at this time. Even more tragic is the fact that the young girl's mother Lisa still has no idea\u00a0as she was left critically injured in the blast and is still fighting for her own life.\n\nSaffie's older sister is also being treated for injuries she suffered during the attack.\n\nGeorgina Callander, 18, lost her life as well in the attack, just hours after the teenager tweeted at Ariana to let her know how excited she was to see her in concert.\n\nTwo years prior, Georgina had got to go backstage and meet Grande after her performance, and later shared one of the photos she took with the pop star.\n\nSaffie and Georgina lived just two miles from one another in the village of Tarleton, and on Tuesday their friends, family, neighbors and even complete strangers gathered to remember the young girls, whose lives were cut tragically short.\n\nSome carried balloons and others flowers while many had signs that read 'I LOVE MCR.'\n\nWith the whole of Britain in mourning over this tragedy, both political parties agreed to halt campaigning ahead of the upcoming June 6 election our of respect for the victims.\n\nA number of celebrities also offered up their thoughts and prayers in the wake of Monday night's attack.\n\nDavid Beckham, who became a global sports superstar while playing for Manchester United, posted on Facebook: 'Heartbreaking news from Manchester. As a father and a human what has happened truly saddens me. My thoughts are with all of those that have been affected by this tragedy...'\n\nHis Spice Girl-turned designer wife Victoria, who lived in Manchester after marrying Beckham, added: 'My heartfelt thoughts and prayers for all those effected by the tragedy in Manchester last night.'\n\nSwift, who later offered up her private jet to Ariana, wrote:\u00a0'My thoughts, prayers and tears for all those affected by the Manchester tragedy tonight. I'm sending all my love.'\n\nKaty Perry also commented on the violent attack, saying:\u00a0'Praying for everyone at @arianagrande's show... Broken hearted for the families tonight.

It's famous all over the world for so many wonderful things, great football teams, Man City, Man United. It's famous for incredible music, Oasis and Joy Division.\n\n'It was the birthplace of the leader of the suffragettes, it's the home of the inventor of the first computer. It's a place full of comedy, and curries, and character.\n\n'But when I think of Manchester, the place that I know, I think of the spirit of the people there, and I'm telling you a more tight knit group of people you will be hard pressed to find.\n\n'Strong, proud, caring people with community at its core, and if it was even possible, the spirit of the people of Manchester will grow even stronger this evening.\n\n'My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Manchester tonight, all of the staff of the MEN arena, all of the security teams, all of the emergency services, Ariana and her team, and all of those families affected by tonight. We'll all go to bed, holding our little ones even tighter this evening.'\n",

She\u2019s scaring the hell out of everyone.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, the 69-year-old showbiz legend spends most of her time revisiting her past with Sonny, her longtime performing partner who died on Jan. 5, 1998, at the age of 62.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about Sonny nowadays,\u201d said the source.\n\nMost disturbing of all, \u201cshe\u2019s been paying secret visits to Sonny\u2019s grave and giving away many of her possessions,\u201d added the source.\n\nSonny and Cher were married from 1964 to 1975, and charted six Top 10 hits, including the classics, \u201cI Got You Babe\u201d and \u201cThe Beat Goes On.\u201d\n\nHe was killed in a horrible skiing accident in Nevada and is buried near Palm Springs, Calif., where he served as mayor and later was elected to Congress.\n\n\u201cCher goes to his gravesite with flowers and comes back all weepy and looking like death warmed over,\u201d said the source. \u201cShe\u2019s even cried, \u2018I\u2019m ready to be with Sonny again.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\nAs The ENQUIRER reported in April, the Oscar-winning \u201cMoonstruck\u201d star \u2013 who is worth a reported $320 million \u2013 is suffering from both physical ailments, and the stress of a turbulent personal life.\n\nAt the time, she was also dealing with her disastrous D2K concert tour, which was plagued by infighting, lawsuits and medical woes that left a \u201cdevastated\u201d Cher canceling 23 shows.\n\nDealing with her children has also taken a debilitating toll on the \u201cMask\u201d star, insiders said. Last year Cher forced her estranged son, Elijah Blue Allman, and his new bride to leave her Malibu home, which she believes is haunted by Sonny.\n\nShe\u2019s also deeply concerned that her transgendered and outspoken son, Chaz, could be a target by appearing at gay pride rallies.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cBelieve\u201d singer\u2019s longtime battle with the Epstein\u2013Barr virus has wreaked havoc on her heart and kidneys.\n\nAt the time of her first bout with the viral infection \u2013 during which she vanished for five months in the early 1990s \u2013 Cher told a friend: \u201cThis disease makes me feel bone-weary, deeply depressed \u2013 and as though all my muscles have turned to Jell-O!\u201d\n\nAs The ENQUIRER reported at the time, her publicist told us that doctors had outfitted her with a heart monitor after continuing kidney woes.\n\nWhen contacted about the specific allegations in this story, her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg told The ENQUIRER that Cher had fully recovered and any claims that she\u2019s headed for an early grave were false and inaccurate.\n\nBut recent photographs of a somber Cher on a visit to St. Tropez were telling: She had to be supported by friends who firmly grasped her arms, believing she was close to collapse. \u201cCher\u2019s been there before and always loved it. But she regrets never having visited with Sonny,\u201d said the source.\n\n\u201cThey planned on going a number of times, but something always happened.\n\n\u201cNow, Cher wanted to go with Sonny on her mind. She\u2019s calling it the visit she and Sonny \u2018always wanted but never had.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nDespite the trip, the frustrated entertainer has confined herself to her Malibu mansion.\n\n\u201cCher has a golf cart that she loves,\u201d said one local. \u201cShe used to be seen driving [it] around Malibu with a hat and glasses. She would wave to people and chat, but those little rides seem to be a thing of the past.\u201d\n\nOther Malibu sources told The ENQUIRER that Cher seems \u201cvery isolated,\u201d while former members of her inner circle are saddened to see her spending her days in bed using a laptop to rant on social media about politics.\n\n\u201cHer management even went to Cher to say she\u2019s got to tone it down, because she\u2019s coming across as angry,\u201d another source said. \u201cBut she told them to f\u2013k off.\u201d\n\nAdded the friend: \u201cIt\u2019s like Cher knows it\u2019s all over, and she\u2019s ready to go. She\u2019s hoping Sonny will be there waiting for her in Heaven.\u201d\n",

She\u2019s grown tired of sharing her personal life on television, and now that she\u2019s working harder than ever before, she doesn\u2019t even have the time to shoot scenes for the show anymore.\n\nFrom Kendall Jenner\u2019s point of view, the 21-year-old wants to build a brand that\u2019s mainly focused on her modeling career. Sources say that by being on reality TV, Kendall thinks it could potentially hinder her chances of being taken seriously in the fashion industry.\n\nShe\u2019s worked extremely hard to distance herself from being known as nothing more than Kim Kardashian\u2019s little sister, and while it\u2019s paid off for her, for the most part, Kendall Jenner can\u2019t stress enough that she needs to leave the world of reality television to truly be taken seriously by some of the biggest fashion designers in the world.\n\nSharing everything about her life, including who she\u2019s dating, could potentially have an effect on the relationship she will go on to form with industry people. To eventually become as famous and successful as Naomi Campbell or Kate Moss, being on reality television is not going to cut it for her.\n\n\u201cKendall will still make some appearances here and there in [KUWTK], and in Kylie\u2019s new show, but only when she\u2019s in town and around \u2014 she wants to limit her time on camera as much as possible,\u201d an insider tells Hollywood Life.\n\nFor now, she has limited the amount of appearance she makes on KUWTK, along with her sister\u2019s forthcoming reality show, Life of Kylie. But her overall intentions are to eventually stop making appearances entirely, saying that it\u2019s no longer where her mind is at.\n\n\u201cKendall\u2019s modeling career is going really amazing, and she\u2019s worked so hard to be taken seriously. She feels like she\u2019s finally getting there and that she\u2019s now being booked because she\u2019s Kendall the model, not just one of the Kardashians. Kendall is grateful for the start in her career that the show gave her, it was a great springboard for her, but at the same time, it was a hiderence\u2014and it\u2019s not the thing that she wants to be known for in her life.\u201d\n\nLast month, the E! network confirmed that Kylie Jenner had landed her own spin-off titled Life of Kylie, Variety reports, which is expected to premiere in July.\n\nThe series will follow Kylie on her journey to branching out and building an empire that\u2019s focused on beauty and cosmetics.\n\nKylie Cosmetics, her reputable company, is already said to make millions in profit each month, and while Kylie the businesswoman will often be seen on the show, Kendall\u2019s little sister will also touch upon personal subjects such as her breakup with Tyga.\n\nAnything that could potentially make Kendall Jenner look bad is something that she wants to stay away from, so if there\u2019s any sort of drama or tension on Kylie\u2019s show, Kendall is sure to keep her distance because she doesn\u2019t want to be seen in that light.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s a wise move for Kendall Jenner to ditch KUWTK in favor of building a respected modeling career with longevity?\n",

'Brad and Angelina split up for a reason, so if she succeeds in getting back with him, she may end up unhappy.\n\n'She is making a foolish mistake if she thinks she can manipulate him back into her life using magic. He has free will. If they are meant to be together, then love and their highest selves will find a way.'\n\nCarrie, who is ordained as a Priestess Of the Goddess and teaches people how to connect with the 'mystical goddess energies', also noted how Angelina and Brad had a mutual tattooing session last year, months before their union ended,\n\nIt was a symbolic effort to 'bind their marriage', but it failed because she was 'forcing' them to stay together, she said.\n\nCarrie says Angelina has always been interested in the 'dark arts'.\n\n'The way she used to wear her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton's blood in a vial around her neck, this is a form of blood magic,' she explained.\n\n'It feeds into her tendencies towards BDSM. For her, obsession and possession equal love.'\n\n'Angelina is known to have a strong interest in the occult, especially Voodoo and Hoodoo.\n\nCarrie has shared a spell for those looking for love at Halloween, but advises that anyone who uses it must have pure intentions. Trying to control someone else\u2019s will, as she believes Angelina is doing with her magic, won\u2019t work.\u00a0 'When a person works magic to \"keep\" or \"get\" a particular love interest, it may work, but only for a short period of time,' she said.\u00a0 Light the incense, turn down the lights and play the music softly.\u00a0 Anoint the candle with rose or jasmine oil and, focusing on the candle, call upon the Goddess, saying: 'Great Goddess Hathor, Goddess of Love, of Beauty and Joy, I ask that you be here present this night, that I may voice my true desire for a lover in my life who will lift my heart with passionate joy.\u00a0 May they be guided to my side that we may share a love so true. May our hearts sing with joy in honour of you. Guide me to be in the right place at the right time to meet my heart\u2019s desire, and that they be ready and willing to love me with a passion equal to mine. Show me my new love, O Goddess divine.' Now light the candle and place it in the candlestick on a table and say: 'So mote it be!' Then take the handheld mirror and gaze into it. Allow your eyes to lose their focus and, as you look at your reflection, see if another face appears before you. Who is it? Is it someone you already know?\u00a0 Perhaps you will see yourself in a particular situation, look at where you are, taking note of the details. How do you appear? Who else is there? This may be where you meet your lover.\u00a0 When you feel ready, re-focus your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room. Thank Hathor for gifting you the vision and say: 'Hail and farewell.'\u00a0Then let the candle burn all the way down.\n\n'Whilst these traditions are not necessarily dark, there is the option here to use the magic for a darker purpose.\n\n'In all magic, the choice between working the spell for good or bad is really down to the intention of the practitioner.\n\n'It's like opening a very potent toolbox, you can use the tools however you wish, but there will be consequences.\n\n'This is why we recommend proper training in magical practice. It's to protect the practitioner as well as the subjects of their magic,' said Carrie.\n\nAngelina is also a devotee of tattoos and before she split from Brad, the couple were inked alongside one another by ex Thai monk Ajarn Noo Kanpai, who they flew to Siem Reap in Cambodia in February 2016 to work on the symbolic designs.\n\nShe acquired three new mystical sak yant back inkings from the Thai artist, a style which encompasses lines of script, geometric patterns and animal shapes, while Brad had the\u00a0left side of his stomach tattooed with a Buddhist symbol.\n\nThe process was meant to 'symbolically bind them as husband and wife', but they ended up splitting in September 2016.\n\nCarrie said: 'This is a classic case of the magic rebounding, as she was trying to force them to stay together.\n\n'She uses her tattoos as protective talismans but they are not linked to witchcraft.\n\n'They're magical though, in that she associates them with protective qualities. So she is using the magic of the Far East. This is not witchcraft as we on the West know it - it's the \"magic\" of another culture.'\n\nThe star also reportedly used magic to woo her man, by presenting him with a vial of grey powder that turned out to be a cremated bat,\u00a0purportedly to ward off negative energies and accidents.\n\n'It's more likely that this was intended to bind him to her,' Carried explained.\n\n'She comes across as a bit insecure so she may have felt that she needed the magic to seal the deal and prevent any other witches or occultists from attacking her or sabotaging her love life.\n\nIt's all about the sex with Angelina, and by that I mean the power she can exert over a man. This is like an elixir, the ultimate possession.\n\n'She clearly wanted Brad very much and would not consider letting him go. But ultimately, this is a fool's game as there's no point in trying to make someone be with you.\n\n'They have free will and entrapping them will only lead to unhappiness. Why would anyone want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with them?'\n\nAssisting the lovelorn is one of Carrie's many talents. 'I've helped all kinds of people using magic,' she says. 'People with legal issues, love troubles, fears and insecurities.\n\n'I guide them through transformation in their lives, by showing them how to face their fears and follow their true path.'\n\nWhen working with people who've come to her, Carrie has found that some are \u2013 or have been \u2013 witches.\n\n'I believe that many people are born witches, and that they have been witches, healers and psychics in previous lives. These people often bring with them a fear of persecution due to the history of so many witches being executed,' she claims.\n\n'When working with them, it's important for me to help them heal past life trauma so that they can be themselves in this life and do the work that they're destined to do.\n",

Bieber shocked millions of fans yesterday when he revealed he was calling off the Purpose tour months before it was due to end as he was \"burned out.\" The Canadian has revealed he wants to get back to his religious roots\n\nHe wrote on Facebook that he was was feeling exhausted after 18 long months on the road. However, sources claim Bieber may now be looking at starting up his own church as part of his plan to get closer to God.\n\n\"[He\u2019s] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he\u2019s looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own \u2013 starting his own church \u2013 we\u2019re not quite sure, but that\u2019s the word from an inside source.\u201d\n\nA statement on the star's Facebook site read: \u201cDue to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts.\n\nOne wrote: \" I'm sad, but i understand. I wish nothing but the best for Justin Bieber and hope all is well. I will be at his next tour and will keep him in prayer.\"\n\nWhile another posted: \"I hope you're okay Justin xxx Your health and wellbeing is more important than the tour.\n\n\"We beliebers support you no matter what. None of us care so much about the tour at the moment ...we care about you and your team. Well done for all the hard work you and the rest of the crew did over the past 18 months Love you xxx\"\n\nOver the last two years, Bieber has admitted he had turned to God as way of getting his life back on the straight and narrow.\n\nIn a media interview, the Canadian said that God had come to him when he was lost.\n\nHe believed that \"the almighty\" was telling him something.\n\nThat was when he decided to change his life for the better and in his own words, \"get his stuff together.\"\n\nAnd just last month, he took a leap of faith off a cliff in New Zealand, symbolically marking a new chapter in his journey with Christ.\n\nBieber said the name of \"Jesus\" before launching himself off a cliff at New Zealand's famous Shotover Canyon Swing & Canyon Fox nature reserve.\n\nHe fell backwards with closed eyes and hands behind his head.\n\nThe video of his fall has reached millions of people. He captioned it #airbaptism and #gracefall.\n\nBieber was raised in a Christian home but fame and millions of dollars at an early age eroded his relationship with God.\n\nHe claims all of that changed when he rededicated his life to Christ and got rebaptised in 2017.\n\nNow he uses his music to express his newfound faith, including singing worship songs at his concerts, and posting pictures of him at church on social media.\n\nBAD BOY From drink-drive arrests to egging houses, Bieber's most outrageous antics Justin Bieber was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs. The star had been drag racing a yellow Lamborghini on a Miami beach street with R&B singer Khalil, who had been driving a red Ferrari. Charges were later dropped in an agreement which required Bieber to, among other things, go to anger management counselling and make a large donation to the \u201cOur Kids\u201d organization. Hours after his lawyer filed a not guilty plea to his drunk-driving charge, Justin Bieber was then charged with assault for allegedly hitting a limousine driver repeatedly in the back of the head. The alleged assault occurred when the driver collected six people from a Toronto nightclub on 29 December 2013. However criminal charges against Bieber were late withdrawn. Pilots of a private jet taking Justin Bieber and his entourage to the Super Bowl were forced to wear oxygen masks to protect against inhaling marijuana fumes which were filling the plane. NBC news reported that the captain of the plane was so concerned about the abusive behaviour of Bieber and his father towards a flight attendant that he had to move her away from them. Probably the most famous incident, Bieber was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation and five days community service for egging the house of his neighbour, sports-agent Jeff Schwartz. As well as community service Bieber was also ordered to pay almost $90,000 in damages to his neighbour and undergo anger management counselling. Bieber stormed off stage mid-performance in Manchester after demanding that the crowd stop screaming in between his songs. However the singer did later return to finish his set. The pop star is filmed apparently punching a fan in Barcelona. The fan leaned into Bieber\u2019s moving vehicle to touch him and footage shows Bieber seemingly responding by punching the fan in the face\n",

An insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the comedian wants to be roasted on Comedy Central so she can put herself in a better spotlight. Will it work?\n\n\nKathy Griffin, 56, has a reputation of pushing the limits when it comes to comedy, but a lot of people felt like her recent stunt went too far. After posing for photographer Tyler Shields, 35, where she held a bloody Donald Trump head, the public expressed some massive outrage and hardcore backlash \u2014 she even got fired from CNN\u2019s annual NYE special. So is her reputation officially destroyed? Maybe not.\n\n\n\nKathy wants to be the next celebrity roasted on Comedy Central. \u201cKathy knows that she has to combat the recent turmoil she is in with comedy and she wants to face things head on and she wants to be the next person to get roasted,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Kathy thinks this could help save her reputation since she is always lightened up when people tease her. \u201cShe wants to show she can take a joke and thinks it will humanize her and make her look better to those she has angered,\u201d our source adds. \u201cShe would love to be the next person that Comedy Central considers.\u201d\n\nComedy Central has roasted a good amount of celebrities, including Justin Bieber, 23, Rob Lowe, 53, and James Franco, 39. Odds are likely that if Kathy does become the next person to get roasted, then the Trump pic will be one of the biggest moments that comes up. And, perhaps, some other celebs will mock her in a way that makes her look better than she does now. But it might be hard to find someone willing to participate in the roast since a lot of celebrities have expressed their disappointment in her, including Debra Messing, 48, Jeffrey Wright, 51, Don Cheadle, 52, and of course, the president, himself.\n\n\nKathy took to her Instagram page on May 30 to post an apology video for the photo. \u201cI sincerely apologize. I\u2019m just now seeing the reaction of these images. I\u2019m a comic, I crossed the line and I went way too far,\u201d she said. \u201cThe image is too disturbing.

    "text": "\nRyan Seacrest is reportedly having a hard time adjusting to life in New York City. The talk show and radio host is renting a place in Manhattan so that he can be in the Big Apple during the week in order to host Live! with Kelly Ripa each morning. However, a new report from Radar Online claims that Seacrest \u2014 who had previously been living in Los Angeles \u2014 is \u201cmiserable\u201d on the East Coast.\n\n\u201cRyan is miserable. [Moving was] the biggest mistake of his life. He hasn\u2019t embraced the city and hasn\u2019t been going out to the restaurants or parties. He\u2019s invited to almost every event every night and doesn\u2019t go! He\u2019s such an LA guy and is finding NYC tough. The weather and the hustle of the city is too much. He can\u2019t wait until the weekends to fly back to his beloved LA,\u201d a source told the popular gossip site.\n\nAlthough Radar Online doesn\u2019t name a source and has been known to fabricate stories from time to time, this one has some people convinced. It seems more than obvious that Seacrest loved living in Los Angeles and he travels to the West Coast so frequently that one could assume he\u2019s unhappy in New York. He has been rooted in California for years and is used to a different way of life. Moving across the country would be a huge change for anyone, let alone someone famous who has loved that LA lifestyle for so long.\n\nThis new report coincides with constant rumors that Seacrest and his Live! co-host, Kelly Ripa, aren\u2019t getting along. Although the two have been pals for many years, sources have said that they are at each other\u2019s throats and that their on-air chemistry (which some fans wouldn\u2019t argue doesn\u2019t even exist) ends the moment the cameras stop rolling.\n\nAs previously reported by the Inquisitr, ratings on Live! have dipped since the announcement that Seacrest was the new co-host. However, that dip was almost to be expected, given the hype built up around the announcement, which had been building for a whole year. However, sources have said that Seacrest wasn\u2019t Ripa\u2019s first choice \u2014 and maybe not even her second choice. For fans of Live!, Seacrest wasn\u2019t even in their top five (favorite contenders included Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Fred Savage, Jerry O\u2019Connell, and even Kelly\u2019s husband, Mark Consuelos).\n\nSo, if any of these rumors are true, will Seacrest end up leaving Live!? It is definitely a possibility. However, the gig hasn\u2019t seemed right for Seacrest since his name was announced on Monday, May 1. Some fans feel that he wasn\u2019t the best choice to be Ripa\u2019s co-host \u2014 and maybe that\u2019s going to turn out to be true.\n\nThere are plenty of rumors out there suggesting that Seacrest is going to leave Live! in 2018. It is entirely possible that he will want to move back to Los Angeles \u2014 and that he may ink a deal to host the new American Idol. That gig has been a part of him for so many years that it almost seems impossible for the show to be successful without him.\n\nDetails of Seacrest\u2019s contract with Live! are unknown. He may have signed a one-year deal or he may have signed a multi-year deal. However, there are always ways for someone to get around something if they aren\u2019t happy or it\u2019s not working.\n\nDo you think Seacrest and Ripa are good together? Do you think Seacrest would prefer to move back to Los Angeles and leave morning talk in the past? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.\n",

The couple didn\u2019t look as happy as they are reported to be. It\u2019s been months since fans have seen FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson together.\n\nThey keep their relationship low-key for the most part. It\u2019s probably because FKA Twig has to deal with the crazy Twilight fans bugging her on social media. She looked really sour when they went to the red-carpet premiere of Robert Pattinson\u2019s latest movie Good Time.\n\nRobert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were glowing on the red carpet. While Robert Pattinson seemed ecstatic to be there, his girlfriend struggled to smile during the event. FKA Twigs stood beside him in a busy Dior gown that she paired her look with nude fuzzy boots and a black choker with a gold crucifix hanging from it.\n\nThe Daily Mail noticed that she kept looking at the floor as she walked out of their hotel to head to the screening. Robert Pattinson kept it classic with his black tuxedo.\n\nHe was later joined by co-stars Taliah Webster and Buddy Duress, writer and co-director Ben Safdie, and co-director Joshua Safdie. Robert Pattinson reportedly got engaged to FKA Twigs back in August 2015. The couple has kept their relationship out of the public eye as much as possible. Despite stepping out together at public events, they rarely speak out about their relationship. Though FKA Twigs has said that the public attention that she has garnered is \u201c100 percent worth it.\u201d\n\nShe told The Observer back in 2014 that she is not who she portrays on the red carpet. She only attends these events to support \u201cthe man that I love.\u201d She also remarked about the media who scrutinizes every move on her red carpet. FKA Twigs admits that she looks uncomfortable at red carpet events because they are not her thing. But, that doesn\u2019t stop her from loving and supporting Robert Pattinson.\n\nRobert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were all smiles when they celebrated his 31st birthday earlier this month in Culver City, Los Angeles. The actor beamed and even displayed PDA with FKA as they joined friends at an intimate party at Akasha restaurant. However, FKA Twigs seemed engaged with her phone every time Robert Pattinson was talking about something. The couple were later seen hugging and kissing each other outside the venue.\n\nCheck back with CDL for more Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs news and updates here.\n",

Kim Kardashian, 35, has had several famous exes she could have turned to when she wanted to have a child, and since she froze her eggs,\u00a0she may have asked one of them to become a baby daddy.\u00a0Let's take a look at who the candidates could be!\n\nAccording to a cover story in Star magazine, Kim froze her eggs in 2012 when she was worried about her ticking biological clock, and had an ex fertilize one before she got with Kanye. \"There'd been buzz that Kim had frozen some embryos, which she'd created with an ex-boyfriend's sperm, so she could have a baby when she was ready.\"\n\nSo who could the daddy be? We know Kim always deeply loved Reggie Bush, 31, as they dated on and off for three years, from 2007 \u2013 2010. And he sure is handsome and would make beautiful babies! North's daddy definitely is a man of color so the NFL star could be a candidate.\n\nHer most recent ex would have been Kris Humphries, 31, who Kim was infamously married to for 72 days in 2011. While their union ended on bitter terms, could she have still turned to him to help father a baby? After all, they still weren't divorced when Kim became pregnant shortly after she started dating Kanye. And what about her sex tape partner Ray J, 35? Could Kim have asked him for a daddy favor?\n\nStream music, completely unlimited and ad-free, RIGHT HERE\n\nStar's report claims\u00a0that Kanye wasn't as eager about having kids as Kim was.\u00a0\"When Kanye refused to back down, Kim may have had one of the embryos implanted,\" their source said. \"She didn't have time to wait for Kanye,\" the magazine claims.\n\n\"People are speculating that Kim tricked Kanye into believing they conceived in Italy so he wouldn't figure out the real story, that she'd already been implanted with an embryo that had another man's DNA!\" according to their story.\n\nWhile neither Kim or Kanye has commented yet, this story is pretty unbelievable. North looks like an absolutely perfect genetic combination of Kim and Kanye that simply cannot be denied!\n\nCheck out Kim's book, Selfish, right now on Amazon.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think there's any chance that North isn't Kanye's biological daughter?\n",

Her funeral was November 20 -- the same day he cancelled his show at the L.A. Forum. The following day -- November 21 -- Kanye cancelled the remainder of the tour and hours later suffered the breakdown.\n\nPeople close to Kanye tell us he never effectively grieved over his mom's death and has always had a difficult time in November, but this time he reached the breaking point.\n\nKanye, we're told, has had trouble handling stress over the last few months, and in the week or so before the breakdown he started to unravel.\n\nAs we reported ... Kanye became paranoid when he was taken to UCLA ... refusing for a time to even let doctors touch him. He also ranted that people were trying to ruin his marriage.\n\nKanye was sedated and is being treated by doctors and mental health professionals. Doctors hoped to release him 2 days ago, but that didn't happen and so far ... no new release date.\n",

Simpson,\" Felix claimed the 31-year-old Kardashian had begged Simpson to put the paternity question to rest with a test.\n\nKardashian is the third of four children born to Robert Kardashian, who died of esophageal cancer in 2003, and Kris Jenner, who divorced him in 1991.\n\nThe reality star set off ceaseless rumors after speculating on a 2009 episode of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" that she might be adopted \u2014 and even swabbed her mom's mouth for a DNA test.\n\nThey continued to fend off gossip over Kardashian's paternity, particularly after Robert Kardashian's ex-wives Jan Ashley and Ellen Kardashian, who he married after divorcing Jenner, suggested in a 2012 Star Magazine story that she wasn't a member of the famous family.\n\nKhloe Kardashian got first taste of racism during O.J. trial\n\"The audacity you have to mention my father's name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low,\" Kardashian, then married to Lamar Odom, tweeted at the time. \"YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).\"\n\nJenner later chimed in during a \"Good Morning America\" interview, calling the theory \"crap\" and telling its promoters to \"get a life.\"\n\n\"I was there, right. I gave birth, I know who the dad was. Everything\u2019s good. We\u2019re all good,\" the momager said.\n\nThe ex-NFL star was famously acquitted of the murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman in the 1995 \"Trial of the Century,\" during which Robert Kardashian served as a member of Simpson's legal dream team.\n\nJenner, who has admitted she wasn\u2019t faithful to the trial lawyer during their marriage, was a close friend of Brown Simpson.\n\nNot to be licensed for fine art prints or consumer products.

I\u2019m no longer interested in the daily facade. I\u2019ve put everything I know into these paintings.\u201d\n\nCarrey first met Donald Trump at a boxing match held at the\u00a0Trump Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City in the early 90s. A popular TV actor at the time, Carrey was criticized by Trump\u2019s associates for \u201cfailing to entertain\u201d the future president.\n\nBut according to Carrey, he was \u201cavoiding him like the plague\u201d because he witnessed Trump shapeshifting when he arrived at the venue.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has a long reptile face, an oversized beak, and his scales are a disgusting grey color, like sewer water,\u201d Carrey said.\n\nExplaining that Donald Trump shapeshifted between this state and his human form \u201cat least three times\u201d while greeting him, Carrey claims that he also saw Trump shapeshifting while greeting other celebrity guests.\n\n\u201cHis hands turned into scaly reptile hands while he gesticulated at random acquired objects he deemed beautiful or valuable. When he smiled his teeth changed into razor sharp reptile teeth and glistened like jewel-encrusted daggers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just me.\u00a0I\u2019m not going to name names, but these secrets are well known in certain circles, among those in the know.\u201c\n\nCarrey says he believes Trump shapeshifted while greeting him as a show of strength and a warning not to mess with the dominant reptilian-political Illuminati of which he is a \u201cblood prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis branch of the Illuminati, the most powerful branch, they come from Bavaria,\u201d Carrey said, explaining that \u201cBavaria is Trump\u2019s ancestral homeland.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had proof of his claims, Carrey told his supporters to \u201cwatch what happens when these issues get raised in the media. The gatekeepers will try to deny I said these things. When that doesn\u2019t work, they will try and destroy my reputation.\u201d\n\nCarrey also told his fans and supporters to \u201clook deeply\u201d at his artworks to \u201cdecipher their real meaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some things you can\u2019t say, but you can paint. I have put everything I know into those paintings.\u201c\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1am, I\u2019m eating goldfish and talking about reptilianism with new friends. I\u2019ve never felt more at peace,\u201d Carrey said.\n\nCarrey\u2019s first hand experiences with the reptilian-Illuminati chime with my own research and second hand accounts.\u00a0 I have dedicated the last five years to researching the elusive, tyrannical powers that rule our world, travelling to over 80 countries, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people from very different walks of life have told me stories about seeing \u2018people\u2019 briefly turn into reptilians before their very eyes.\n\nI\u2019ve been told this by Californian news anchors, Ethiopian goatherds, and Australian Aboriginals, just to name a few.\u00a0 A Danish taxi driver described driving past a group of VIP guests at the 2014 Bilderberg meeting in Copenhagen and seeing some of their faces turn reptilian and some of their hands and feet take on a reptilian look.\n\nIn Peru a respected psychic told me she sees people in power, like Obama, David Cameron and Hillary Clinton, turn into reptiles whenever she watches an international news channel.\n\nThe world\u2019s ruling class have tyrannical control over the mainstream media, as well as our food, water, and air supply, and they are actively dumbing down the masses.\u00a0 The evidence against them, ancient and modern, is enormous and continuing to grow.\n",

Taylor has always been the bigger money earner in all of her relationships. Even though past boyfriends such as Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, Tom Hiddleston, and Calvin Harris were millionaires, their bank accounts still paled in comparison to Taylor\u2019s whopping $300 million estimated net worth.\n\nBut, Taylor Swift is now dating relatively unknown actor, Joe Alwyn, who has yet to see big-screen success, and fans are wondering if it\u2019s true or false news that she is spending millions of dollars supporting the relationship. His first film, \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk\u201d garnered him good reviews from critics, but not much of a paycheck. In fact, Joe has admitted to still living at home with his parents in London.\n\nTaylor Swift met Joe Alwyn last fall through mutual friends and decided to move to London in order to be closer to the struggling actor. She rented a beautiful home in North London close to where Joe\u2019s parents lived. Home rentals in London are some of the most expensive in the world, with some claiming a London rental can cost twice as much as renting elsewhere, but Taylor thought Joe was worth it and signed a six month lease so the two could be together.\n\nNow comes word that she is yet again willing to drop a ton of cash for the actor. Taylor is reportedly shopping for a home for the two of them to share in London\u2019s affluent Chelsea neighborhood. Money is no object and she is willing to pay millions to live in the wealthy neighborhood which other famous Brits, including Pippa Middleton call home.\n\nAlthough she and Joe will be spending the majority of their time at her house in Los Angeles so he can work on future film roles, Joe is very close to his parents and wants a home close to them so he can visit often and Taylor is willing to make that happen.\n\nIt\u2019s not only real-estate that the Grammy winner is willing to spend money on when it comes to her new love. Taylor and Joe have been traveling using her private jets , and just this weekend, the two were seen boarding her private plane in London. The pair first flew to LA to let Joe get settled in Taylor\u2019s home and then the couple headed to Nashville so her new beau could meet her parents.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Taylor Swift apparently doesn\u2019t mind spending millions of dollars on Joe Alwyn, some of the singer\u2019s own fans are starting to feel embarrassed that the pop star is the one footing all the bills and are wondering if a relationship will work out between the two in the long run. Others are just are hoping that with this move to Los Angeles, other movie offers will come in and his career will finally start to take off.

The Duke and Duchess first fell in love while studying art history at St Andrew\u2019s University in Scotland nearly two decades ago.\n\nEyewitnesses say that art enthusiast Kate Middleton asked lots of questions during their tour of the museum with William by her side. Kate certainly did show the public that she was still angry at her husband as she tried to remain as calm and engaged as possible during their tour.

It\u2019s no secret that the Duchess of Cambridge makes headlines simply because she\u2019s Prince William\u2019s wife. But, if she decides to pull the plug on her royal marriage, Kate\u2019s life won\u2019t be the same.\n\nShe won\u2019t be generating publicity for what she wore or how she looked during her public appearances. And, that\u2019s probably what she\u2019ll miss the most. Kate Middleton loves the spotlight but without the royal family, she won\u2019t be in it anymore.\n\nPlus, royal observers know that if Kate Middleton forgives Prince William for his antics drunken antics now, there\u2019s a good chance that she\u2019ll forgive him again and again. In other words, the Duchess is turning a blind eye to her husband\u2019s behavior because she probably doesn\u2019t have any other choice.

I do not know what happened at the end. I learned a lot from her, though.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI was not surprised by her reaction at all, but I cannot control somebody else\u2019s actions. I was there four years, and it is about more than just being in front of the camera.\u201d\n\nAn article recently appeared on BET, where an insider said Strahan wants to have a sit-down with Ripa.\n\nThe source revealed: \u201cMichael is 100% behind meeting with Kelly and clearing the air. These two were TV-husband-and-wife for many years and to go from seeing someone five days a week to having zero contact makes no sense to him. Through mutual friends, Michael has made it clear that he would love to set up drinks or a private meeting with Kelly.\u201d\n\nIt is being claimed Ripa has turned him down.\n",

But this year, fans of the actor were left disappointed when he chose to ignore them and the media while he and the cast of the upcoming superhero film, \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d were at Comic-Con to promote their film, which will hit theaters later this year. Tom Hiddleston\u2019s portrayal of villan, Loki in the comic book superhero movie, \u201cThor\u201d has garnered him legions of fans, mostly female who love his bad boy portrayal of the character.\n\nAlthough Tom Hiddleston did participate in a panel with the other actors to answer questions about their upcoming film, he chose to skip the the opportunity to take photos with fans or sign autographs. This has left his fans feeling disappointed because some fans actually traveled thousands of miles for the chance to see Tom and get a picture with him.\n\nThis is a huge departure from years past, when Tom Hiddleston made it a point to see as many fans as possible. In 2013, while promoting \u201cThor: The Dark World\u201d, Tom surprised and delighted fans by coming to the convention dressed in his full Loki costume. But this year he all but ignored his fans and only briefly appeared on the panel with the other actors and director of the movie, and left the convention as soon as the panel was over.\n\nAudience members also remarked that the usually charming actor didn\u2019t appear too excited to be at Comic-Con, with some of Tom\u2019s own fans commenting that the actor appeared to look sad or unhappy. And it wasn\u2019t just his fans that Tom ignored, he also chose to not speak to the media while at the convention. Besides a few questions from fans and the media during the panel discussion, Tom refused to be interviewed by journalists.\n\nMany believe Tom is still embarrassed by his whirlwind romance with pop star Taylor Swift. Tom and Taylor Swift dated last summer and were heavily criticized for their public displays of affection, including Tom\u2019s decision to wear a tank top declaring his love for the pop star.\n\nOf course, Tom and Taylor Swift\u2019s romance only lasted a few months, but it has been reported\u00a0that his brief romance with the singer has hurt his Hollywood career, and may have even cost him the opportunity to take over the role of James Bond. For the past few months, Tom has kept a low profile with fans and the media, no doubt in hopes of avoiding questions about his past relationship with Taylor Swift.\n",

Maddox's real Cambodian father has come forward with the shocking claims that Jolie doesn't have legal power of attorney over the 15-year-old.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Dirty Laundry, Mounh Sarath says that he has official paperwork from Cambodia that confirms he is Maddox's father. Jolie started Maddox's adoption back in 2002, and Brad Pitt legally adopted him in 2006. But according to Sarath, he actually has power of attorney over the teenager.\n\nSarath and Jolie have not spoken to each other in years. Even more scandalous, the adoption agent Jolie worked with, Lauryn Galindo, was jailed for falsifying names, birth places, and dates of children from Cambodia. At the time Jolie adopted Maddox, the United States had just set forth stricter adoption laws for children from Cambodia. Did she rush the process to bypass the stricter laws?\n\nThe Sun reports that Sarath works in charity and local aid in Cambodia. Given his falling out with Jolie and the circumstances surrounding Maddox's adoption, Sarath's opinion of the Tomb Raider star is pretty low.\n\n\"I would be happy if Cambodia didn't see her again,\" he added.\n\nJolie's interest in Cambodia started when she filmed her 2001 hit film in the country, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. She recently directed a movie based in Cambodia, First They Killed My Father, and has visited the country on several different occasions.\n\nThe allegations against Angelina Jolie couldn't have come at a worse time. The actress is currently engaged in a heated custody battle with her ex-husband and just returned from promoting her newest film in Cambodia.\n\nMaddox was also the source of a lot of controversy in Jolie's split with Pitt. Shortly after filing for divorce, reports surfaced that Pitt had physically abused Maddox on a private plane. Pitt was eventually cleared of all the accusations, but not before his public image took a major hit.\n\nThings between Maddox and Jolie, meanwhile, couldn't be better. Hollywood Life reports that Jolie took Maddox and his five siblings on a week-long trip to London. During their stay, Jolie and Maddox ventured off to Buckingham Palace for a mother-son date.\n\nThe pair was spotted leaving the royal palace and looked happier than ever spending time together. It isn't clear if they actually met any members of the royal family, but there's a possibility they mingled with Prince William.\n\nThe outing came after Jolie gave a speech at the London School of Economics. Jolie spoke to a crowd of students about her career promoting human rights around the globe. The actress, who has been an avid human rights activist over the years, also spoke at the United Nations in London.\n\nMaddox was the only member of the Jolie-Pitt family that accompanied Jolie to the palace. Earlier last week, Jolie was spotted taking Maddox's siblings out to a toy store in London. The kids have since returned to the United States.\n\nAs far as Jolie and Pitt are concerned, insiders claim that the drama is starting to cool down. Although they haven't finalized the divorce, a source revealed that they are at a better place in their breakup and are on the verge of working things out.\n\nGiven how their divorce played out in the early months, it's definitely good to hear that Jolie and Pitt are working through their differences. They have not released an official comment on Maddox's adoption.\n\nTell us! Do you think Angelina Jolie could have actually faked the documents to adopt Maddox?

    "text": "\nWhile the Bey Hive was buzzing yesterday about Beyonce's shocking baby news, RadarOnline.com has learned that Kim Kardashian was busy with her own plan to steal back the spotlight!\n\n\"Kim was shocked at the Beyonce news and she was totally checking it out and seeing how many people like the post,\" an insider told Radar. \"Then when her friend Chrissy Teigen started Tweeting that she was best friends with Beyonce, she was actually hurt and worried.\"\n\nAs Radar has reported, there is a longstanding rivalry between Queen Bey and Kardashian, 36, and according to an insider, Kardashian is not letting it go anytime soon!\n\n\"That's why she started Tweeting,\" the source told Radar. \"She thinks she's a bigger star than Beyonce. She is the biggest star in the world.\" And it was time to remind her fans.\n\nThe first attempt came right after Beyonce announced the news. Kardashian took to her Twitter to share with her fans that she had finally updated her app, Kim Kardashian Hollywood!\n\n\"Had to change up my look in #KimKardashianGame! Have you guys seen the latest update? @KKHOfficial,\" Kardashian wrote on Twitter.\n\nSeeing that had not done anything to put a dent in Beyonce's big news, the KUWTK wife of Yeezy rapper, Kanye West, tried yet again \u2013 by announcing that she and pal, Chrissy Tiegen, were starting their own book club.\n\n\"So guys..... @chrissyteigen & @jenatkinhair & I are starting a book club!,\" Kardashian posted. Sadly, no massive celebrations erupted like she was hoping.\n\nBut that's not all! Earlier in the day, Kardashian misled fans to believe that she and West, 39, were ALSO expecting another child together. When a fan asked it it were true, however, Kardashian quickly shot it down.\n\n\"While everyone was tweeting and sending congratulations to Beyonce and Jay Z, Kim and Kanye did not say one word about it on their social media,\" the source told Radar.\n\n\"The fact that Beyonce is going to have more kids than Kim once her twins are born absolutely drives Kim nuts!\"\n\n\"Kim was totally trying to steal Beyonce's baby thunder yesterday.\"\n\nAs Radar reported, Kardashian and West \u2013 like Beyonce and Jay Z \u2013 hit several rough patches in their superstar union this year, leading many to believe that the two were headed for a messy divorce.\n\nBut it seems that one sure-fire way to get over a slump is by getting another baby bump!\n\n\"Kim is going to try harder than ever right now to get pregnant because she is constantly searching for a way to one up Beyonce,\" the insider claimed. \"She seems so jealous that Beyonce is more famous than she is. It doesn't seem like Kim will ever, be okay with that.\"\n\nDo you think that Kim Kardashian should get pregnant so that she can have as many children as Beyonce has? Tell us your thoughts below.\n\n",

Given his shaky track record with women over the years, including a difficult divorce from his first wife and the brief longevity of most Hollywood marriages in general, I think he needs to make sure he has a prenuptial agreement that's ironclad,\" divorce attorney Raoul L.

I expect his lawyers are being very careful and 'fighting' her lawyers over every point.\"\n\nIndeed, Alamuddin's intellect and successful career was an attraction for Clooney, but now it may work against him.\n\nAdding tension to the Lake Como ceremony is an old scandal surrounding one of Clooney's best buddies, Brad Pitt - his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston and current partner Angelina Jolie.\n\nPHOTOS: Waiting At The Altar - 38 Hollywood Weddings That Were Called Off\n\n\"At first she was on the fence about going,\" the source said of Jolie, \"because she's not big on schmoozing at Hollywood get-togethers.

We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details that he wanted to avoid an awkward run-in with Beyonc\u00e9 at all costs.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason that Kanye West, 40, skipped the celebrity wedding of the season when tennis great Serena Williams married Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, 35 in a lavish New Orleans wedding on Nov. 16. While wife Kim Kardashian, 37, attended the big event, he knew that Serena\u2019s close pal Beyonce, 36, was going to be on hand and he didn\u2019t want an awkward confrontation. Especially after he dragged Bey and hubby JAY-Z, 47, so viciously during a Sacramento concert in Nov. of 2016. \u201cIt was no accident that Kanye chose to avoid Serena\u2019s wedding. Kanye is not particularly close with Serena, or her husband, who are more Kim\u2019s friends so Kanye opted out of what he felt may be an awkward evening for him. Kanye knew that Beyonc\u00e9, a close friend of Serena\u2019s, would likely be at the wedding which might make for an uncomfortable situation,\u201d a Yeezy insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\u201cKanye still has a lot of unresolved issues with Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband. So, Kanye told Kim that he was going to sit this one out as to prevent causing a scene and risk stealing attention away from Serena\u2019s big day, which Kim agreed was the smart decision,\u201d our source continues. Yeezy hasn\u2019t come face to face with Bey or Jay since his epic concert rants against them and the worst place for that to happen would be at a joyous event like someone\u2019s wedding. See pics of guests at Serena\u2019s wedding, here.\n\nKim played it safe and made it a girl\u2019s trip to Serena\u2019s big nuptials, bringing along sister Khloe\u2018s BFF Malika Haqq, 34, and her sis Khadijah Haqq, 34, as her dates instead of her hubby. Beyonc\u00e9 also appeared to want to keep the attention on Serena and not any beef she or Jay might still have with Yeezy by leaving her husband at home as well. Kim and Beyonc\u00e9 have never been close, and so no one expected any fireworks with those two being in the same room. They were both seated in the front row for Serena\u2019s wedding, but were separated by Bey\u2019s former Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, 36, and her husband Tim Weatherspoon. The night belonged to the tennis G.O.A.T.\u2019s  fairytale wedding and not anyone else\u2019s drama.\nHollywoodLifers, do you think it was wise of Kanye to skip a confrontation with Beyonc\u00e9 at Serena\u2019s wedding?\n",

But this season, there's speculation that there are just as many battles being fought when the cameras are turned off as when viewers are watching. Is new coach Miley Cyrus secretly involved in a war with seasoned coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton?\n\nBillboard pointed out that when it comes to the impressions of Miley and the other new coach, Alicia Keys, they're hitting the high notes of a position that can challenge even the most accomplished singer.\n\nCoaches are tasked with taking on aspiring crooners, guiding them through the competition and providing them with tips on everything from stage presence to blending with the band. Even though Blake and Adam are experienced at banter, Cyrus and Keys immediately showed they were up to the challenge of teasing the guys while luring the best contestants onto their teams.\n\nBut what viewers can't see is the drama unfolding among Shelton, Levine, and Miley, according to OK. The battle has become so intense that Cyrus was hurt to the point of tears, and now she's doing her best to stay on the show and avoid quitting.\n\nTeam Miley seems to be rocking it when it comes to attracting the best wanna-be singers on the show, but sources cited by OK revealed that the \"Wrecking Ball\" singer is struggling because of the incessant feuding. However, even though she's battling both Blake and Adam, she is trying to stay strong, added one of the insiders.\n\nCyrus has \"been in tears\" during the filming of the singing competition TV show, with her tears caused by Adam \"constantly\" picking on her, revealed the source. Levine allegedly didn't stop with annoying Miley himself. Instead, he also persuaded his buddy Blake to \"gang up\" on the younger singer, added the insider.\n\nMoreover, the feud reportedly has been gradually building to a crescendo, with Cyrus and Adam \"at each others' throats\" since the first day of filming, according to the source.\n\n\"[Levine] wants nothing to do with [Miley],\" summed up the insider.\n\nEven though Adam has recruited Blake to help him annoy Cyrus, the source shared that it's Levine who is focused on feuding.\n\nAs for just how bad it's gotten, Cyrus has threatened that she will quit The Voice as a result of the environment becoming \"so bad,\" added the insider.\n\nAlicia Keys is noticeably absent from the feud allegations, and Miley recently commented on reports that she and Alicia had teamed up so that for the first time, two female coaches could challenge Blake and Adam.\n\nDishing with Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, Miley clarified that she had not chosen to unite with Alicia in order to have a \"boys against girls\" competition on The Voice. Instead, she has been siding with Keys because being sandwiched between Adam and Blake was infuriating, reported 98.7 Radio.\n\nDespite reports claiming that Levine is bickering with Cyrus, she told Jimmy that in reality, it's Adam and Shelton who are arguing constantly.\n\n\"It never stops,\" she revealed about the bickering between Blake and Adam. \"Even when the cameras are off, that is real.\"\n\nCyrus admitted that when she viewed the show, she assumed that the playful banter was just done for the cameras. But rather than end when filming stops, Levine and Shelton keep right on bickering.\n\n\"I always thought it was like a little thing they do on camera, no, it's all day,\" she summed up.\n",

Superior Court accusing the former model\u00a0of battery and assault, and seeking\u00a0damages for infliction of emotional distress, reports Variety.\n\nJane Doe says she and her husband were performing an ode to their\u00a0daughter, identified as Mary, during\u00a0a taping on March 19. Once they finished, the woman says that she and her husband were \u201chumiliated\u201d by the judges and the audience, who criticized the song.\n\nAccording to the suit, Banks added to the humiliation by making fun of the song in front of Mary. Jane Doe alleges that Banks pulled her daughter\u2019s hair back, physically manipulated her, and insinuated that the girl was accidentally conceived.\n\nAfterward, \u201cMary was traumatized and became deeply depressed,\u201d the suit states. \u201cMary would become extremely nervous and anxious whenever, among other triggering events, she hears any mentions of [the] song and [the] song itself, whenever she ruminates about the events during or related to the performance, and whenever she thinks about the prospective televised airing or use online of Jane Doe and her husband, their performance, as well as the airing and use online of any footages of Mary.\u201d\n\nReality show contestants typically sign waivers acknowledging that they may be subjected to ridicule and humiliation. However, the suit alleges that Marathon Productions got Mary to sign a contract without her parents\u2019 knowledge or consent, according to Variety.\n\nAfter the contestant complained, the company communicated that it would not feature Mary in the broadcast. However, the couple asked that the entire performance not be aired. That request was refused.\n",

Two and a half years after she and Kanye West wed in a multimillion-dollar affair at a 16th century Italian fortress, \"she wants a divorce,\" a Kardashian friend claims in the new issue of Us Weekly. Find out more in the video above and from details below.\n\nPreviously married to record producer Damon Thomas and basketball pro Kris Humphries, the 36-year-old isn't rushing to file papers just yet, adds the pal, but she is planning her next steps. \"It will take some time before she can do anything,\" claims the friend, alleging that she's trying to build a case for full custody of kids North, 3, and Saint, 12 months, \"but she doesn't want to stay married.\"\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is already distancing herself from the \"Fade\" rapper, 39.

Hours after the 21-time Grammy winner was released, he attended the balloon-filled \"low-key\" family party Kardashian held for Saint days before his December 5 birthday, says a West insider.\n\n\n\nThe Kardashian friend says she won't make any decisions until West is fully recovered. Until then, adds the pal, \"she's being a supportive wife.\" And the reality star - who has been in self-imposed seclusion since being robbed in Paris October 3 -\u00a0is happy the musician is on the mend.\n\n\n\n\"She cares about Kanye and feels relieved he's getting the help he needs,\" continues the friend, \"but she's felt trapped for a while.\"\n\nCan't get enough of Us?
