    "text": "The Republican Partys attempt to treat Donald Trump as a normal political candidate would be laughable were it not so perilous to the republic. If only he would mouth the partys conservative principles, all would be well.\r\n\r\nBut of course the entire Trump phenomenon has nothing to do with policy or ideology. It has nothing to do with the Republican Party, either, except in its historic role as incubator of this singular threat to our democracy. Trump has transcended the party that produced him. His growing army of supporters no longer cares about the party. Because it did not immediately and fully embrace Trump, because a dwindling number of its political and intellectual leaders still resist him, the party is regarded with suspicion and even hostility by his followers. Their allegiance is to him and him alone.\r\n\r\nAnd the source of allegiance? Were supposed to believe that Trumps support stems from economic stagnation or dislocation. Maybe some of it does. But what Trump offers his followers are not economic remedies  his proposals change daily. What he offers is an attitude, an aura of crude strength and machismo, a boasting disrespect for the niceties of the democratic culture that he claims, and his followers believe, has produced national weakness and incompetence. His incoherent and contradictory utterances have one thing in common: They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disdain, intermingled with bits of fear, hatred and anger. His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of others  Muslims, Hispanics, women, Chinese, Mexicans, Europeans, Arabs, immigrants, refugees  whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision. His program, such as it is, consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion. He will deport them, bar them, get them to knuckle under, make them pay up or make them shut up.\r\n\r\nThat this tough-guy, get-mad-and-get-even approach has gained him an increasingly large and enthusiastic following has probably surprised Trump as much as anyone else. Trump himself is simply and quite literally an egomaniac. But the phenomenon he has created and now leads has become something larger than him, and something far more dangerous.\r\n\r\nRepublican politicians marvel at how he has tapped into a hitherto unknown swath of the voting public. But what he has tapped into is what the founders most feared when they established the democratic republic: the popular passions unleashed, the mobocracy. Conservatives have been warning for decades about government suffocating liberty. But here is the other threat to liberty that Alexis de Tocqueville and the ancient philosophers warned about: that the people in a democracy, excited, angry and unconstrained, might run roughshod over even the institutions created to preserve their freedoms. As Alexander Hamilton watched the French Revolution unfold, he feared in America what he saw play out in France  that the unleashing of popular passions would lead not to greater democracy but to the arrival of a tyrant, riding to power on the shoulders of the people.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon has arisen in other democratic and quasi-democratic countries over the past century, and it has generally been called fascism. Fascist movements, too, had no coherent ideology, no clear set of prescriptions for what ailed society. National socialism was a bundle of contradictions, united chiefly by what, and who, it opposed; fascism in Italy was anti-liberal, anti-democratic, anti-Marxist, anti-capitalist and anti-clerical. Successful fascism was not about policies but about the strongman, the leader (Il Duce, Der Fhrer), in whom could be entrusted the fate of the nation. Whatever the problem, he could fix it. Whatever the threat, internal or external, he could vanquish it, and it was unnecessary for him to explain how. Today, there is Putinism, which also has nothing to do with belief or policy but is about the tough man who single-handedly defends his people against all threats, foreign and domestic.\r\n\r\nTo understand how such movements take over a democracy, one only has to watch the Republican Party today. These movements play on all the fears, vanities, ambitions and insecurities that make up the human psyche. In democracies, at least for politicians, the only thing that matters is what the voters say they want  vox populi vox Dei. A mass political movement is thus a powerful and, to those who would oppose it, frightening weapon. When controlled and directed by a single leader, it can be aimed at whomever the leader chooses. If someone criticizes or opposes the leader, it doesnt matter how popular or admired that person has been. He might be a famous war hero, but if the leader derides and ridicules his heroism, the followers laugh and jeer. He might be the highest-ranking elected guardian of the partys most cherished principles. But if he hesitates to support the leader, he faces political death.\r\n\r\nIn such an environment, every political figure confronts a stark choice: Get right with the leader and his mass following or get run over. The human race in such circumstances breaks down into predictable categories  and democratic politicians are the most predictable. There are those whose ambition leads them to jump on the bandwagon. They praise the leaders incoherent speeches as the beginning of wisdom, hoping he will reward them with a plum post in the new order. There are those who merely hope to survive. Their consciences wont let them curry favor so shamelessly, so they mumble their pledges of support, like the victims in Stalins show trials, perhaps not realizing that the leader and his followers will get them in the end anyway.\r\n\r\nRNC chairman: Republicans will find common ground with Trump  Play Video0:56\r\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and the GOP will find common ground ahead of the general election. (Reuters)\r\nA great number will simply kid themselves, refusing to admit that something very different from the usual politics is afoot. Let the storm pass, they insist, and then we can pick up the pieces, rebuild and get back to normal. Meanwhile, dont alienate the leaders mass following. After all, they are voters and will need to be brought back into the fold. As for Trump himself, lets shape him, advise him, steer him in the right direction and, not incidentally, save our political skins.\r\n\r\nWhat these people do not or will not see is that, once in power, Trump will owe them and their party nothing. He will have ridden to power despite the party, catapulted into the White House by a mass following devoted only to him. By then that following will have grown dramatically. Today, less than 5 percent of eligible voters have voted for Trump. But if he wins the election, his legions will likely comprise a majority of the nation. Imagine the power he would wield then. In addition to all that comes from being the leader of a mass following, he would also have the immense powers of the American presidency at his command: the Justice Department, the FBI, the intelligence services, the military. Who would dare to oppose him then? Certainly not a Republican Party that lay down before him even when he was comparatively weak. And is a man like Trump, with infinitely greater power in his hands, likely to become more humble, more judicious, more generous, less vengeful than he is today, than he has been his whole life? Does vast power un-corrupt?\r\n\r\nThis is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes (although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence) but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac tapping into popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party  out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear  falling into line behind him.",

    "text": "All politicians bend the truth to fit their purposes, including Hillary Clinton. But Donald J. Trump has unleashed a blizzard of falsehoods, exaggerations and outright lies in the general election, peppering his speeches, interviews and Twitter posts with untruths so frequent that they can seem flighty or random  even compulsive.\r\n\r\nHowever, a closer examination, over the course of a week, revealed an unmistakable pattern: Virtually all of Mr. Trumps falsehoods directly bolstered a powerful and self-aggrandizing narrative depicting him as a heroic savior for a nation menaced from every direction. Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist, described the practice as creating an unreality bubble that he surrounds himself with.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times closely tracked Mr. Trumps public statements from Sept. 15-21, and assembled a list of his 31 biggest whoppers, many of them uttered repeatedly. This total excludes dozens more: Untruths that appeared to be mere hyperbole or humor, or delivered purely for effect, or what could generously be called rounding errors. Mr. Trumps campaign, which dismissed this compilation as silly, offered responses on every point, but in none of the following instances did the responses support his assertions.\r\n\r\nTall Tales About Himself\r\n\r\nMr. Trumps version of reality allows for few, if any, flaws in himself. As he tells it, the polls are always looking up, his policy solutions are painless and simple and his judgment regarding politics and people has been consistent  and flawless. The most consistent falsehood he tells about himself may be that he opposed the war in Iraq from the start, when the evidence shows otherwise.\r\n\r\n1He said a supportive crowd chanted, Let him speak! when a black pastor in Flint, Mich., asked Mr. Trump not to give a political speech in the church.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 15.\r\nThere were no such chants.\r\n2I was against going into the war in Iraq.\r\nSPEECH IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 19.\r\nThis is not getting any truer with repetition. He never publicly expressed opposition to the war before it began, and he made supportive remarks to Howard Stern.\r\n3He said any supportive comments he made about the Iraq war came long before the war began.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.\r\nHe expressed support for the war in September 2002, when Congress was debating whether to authorize military action.\r\n4He said he had publicly opposed the Iraq war in an Esquire interview pretty quickly after the war started.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.\r\nThe Esquire interview appeared in the August 2004 edition, 17 months after the war began.\r\n5Before the Iraq invasion, he said, he had told the Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto something pretty close to: Dont go in, and dont make the mistake of going in.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.\r\nNot remotely close. He told Mr. Cavuto that President George W. Bush had to take decisive action.\r\n6He said that when Howard Stern asked him about Iraq in 2002, it was the first time the word Iraq was ever mentioned to me.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.\r\nMr. Trump expressed alarm about Saddam Hussein and the situation in Iraq in 2000 in his own book.\r\n7You see whats happening with my poll numbers with African-Americans. Theyre going, like, high.\r\nSPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20; MADE SAME CLAIM IN OHIO, SEPT. 21.\r\nPolls show him winning virtually no support from African-Americans.\r\n8Almost, it seems, everybody agrees with his position on immigration.\r\nREMARKS IN TEXAS, SEPT. 17.\r\nMost Americans oppose his signature positions on immigration.\r\n9He has made a lot of progress with Hispanic and black voters, and you see that in the polls.\r\nFRED DICKER RADIO SHOW, SEPT. 15.\r\nNo major poll has shown him making up significant ground with black or Hispanic voters.\r\n10He was never a fan of Colin Powell.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.\r\nIn his book The America We Deserve, he named Mr. Powell as among the best and brightest in American society.\r\n11Mr. Trump said that after The Times published an article scrutinizing his relationships with women, All the women came out and said they think Donald Trump is terrific.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 18.\r\nOnly one woman who was quoted in the article came to his defense after its publication.\r\n12Unlike other people who only raise money for themselves during presidential campaigns, he also raises money for the Republican Party.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 15.\r\nEvery presidential nominee forms a joint fund-raising agreement to share money with his or her national party.\r\nUnfounded Claims About\r\nCritics and the News Media\r\n\r\nIts not just Mrs. Clinton whom Mr. Trump belittles and tars with inaccurate information. He also distorted the facts about his Republican critics, including President George Bush and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. And he claimed that Lester Holt, the NBC anchor moderating the first presidential debate, is a Democrat  but Mr. Holt is a registered Republican.\r\n\r\n13In the primaries, Mr. Kasich won one and, by the way, didnt win it by much  that was Ohio.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 19.\r\nMr. Kasich crushed him in Ohio, winning by 11 percentage points.\r\n14Lester Holt, the NBC anchor and debate moderator, is a Democrat.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 19.\r\nMr. Holt is a registered Republican, New York City records show.\r\n15The presidential debate moderators are all Democrats. Its a very unfair system.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. 19.\r\nOnly one, Chris Wallace of Fox News, is a registered Democrat.\r\n16He said it hasnt been reported that Mrs. Clinton called some Trump supporters deplorable.\r\nSPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.\r\nIt would be difficult to find a news organization that didnt report her remark.\r\nInaccurate Claims About Clinton\r\n\r\nMr. Trump regularly dissembles about his opponent, attributing ideas to Mrs. Clinton that she has not endorsed, or accusing her of complicity in events in which she had no involvement.\r\n\r\n17Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it.\r\nREMARKS IN WASHINGTON, SEPT. 16.\r\nMrs. Clinton and her campaign never publicly questioned President Obamas birthplace; Mr. Trump made it his signature cause for five years.\r\n18Mrs. Clinton had the power and the duty to stop the release of unauthorized immigrants whose home countries would not accept their deportation after they were released from prison.\r\nNUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN COLORADO, SEPT. 17, AND FLORIDA, SEPT. 19.\r\nThe secretary of state does not have the power to detain convicted criminals after they have served their sentences, and has little power to make foreign countries accept deportees.\r\n19Mrs. Clinton has not criticized jihadists and foreign governments that oppress and kill women, gay people and non-Muslims. Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? No.\r\nSPEECH IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 19.\r\nShe has denounced jihadists and foreign countries on the same grounds, if not necessarily using the same words.\r\n20Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies  she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.\r\nTWITTER, SEPT. 20.\r\nHe did not invent the tarmac rally or the campaign-plane backdrop.\r\n21Mrs. Clinton destroyed 13 smartphones with a hammer while she was secretary of state.\r\nSPEECHES IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 15 AND SEPT. 19.\r\nAn aide told the F.B.I. of only two occasions in which phones were destroyed with a hammer.\r\n22He said Mrs. Clinton is calling for total amnesty in the first 100 days, including a virtual end to immigration enforcement and for unauthorized immigrants to receive Social Security and Medicare.\r\nSPEECH IN COLORADO, SEPT. 17.\r\nShe has not proposed this.\r\n23Mrs. Clinton is effectively proposing to abolish the borders around the country.\r\nNUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN TEXAS, SEPT. 17.\r\nShe is not even proposing to cut funding for the Border Patrol.\r\n24Hillary Clintons plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term alone, and would cost $400 billion.\r\nNUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.\r\nShe endorsed admitting 65,000 Syrian refugees this year, on top of other admissions. Mr. Trump is falsely claiming that she wants to do this every year and is estimating the cost accordingly.\r\nStump Speech Falsehoods\r\n\r\nSome warped or inaccurate claims have become regular features of Mr. Trumps stump speech. He routinely overstates the scale and nature of the countrys economic distress and the threats to its national security, and exaggerates the potential for overnight improvements if he were elected.\r\n\r\n25Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that theyve ever been in before  ever, ever, ever.\r\nSPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.\r\nNo measurement supports this characterization of black America.\r\n26Fifty-eight percent of black youth are not working.\r\nNUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 16, AND COLORADO, SEPT. 17.\r\nThis misleading statistic counts high school students as out of work. Black youth unemployment actually was 20.6 percent in July.\r\n27Many dangerous refugees are being welcomed by the Obama administration. Hundreds of thousands of people are being approved to pour into the country. We have no idea who they are.\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE SPEECH, SEPT. 15.\r\nThe Obama administration has admitted more than 10,000 Syrian refugees, using an extensive screening process.\r\n28We have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan.\r\nNUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN FLORIDA, SEPT. 16; COLORADO, SEPT. 17; NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20; OHIO, SEPT. 21; AND A FOX NEWS INTERVIEW ON SEPT. 21.\r\nNo American city resembles a war zone, though crime has risen lately in some, like Chicago. Urban violence has fallen precipitously over the past 25 years.\r\n29Ford plans to cut American jobs by relocating small-car production to Mexico, and may move all production outside the United States.\r\nFOX NEWS INTERVIEW AND NEW HAMPSHIRE SPEECH, SEPT. 15.\r\nMark Fields, Fords chief executive, said it was not cutting American jobs.\r\n30We have a trade deficit this year with China of approximately $500 billion.\r\nNORTH CAROLINA SPEECH, SEPT. 20.\r\nHe has made this claim repeatedly, but the trade deficit with China is significantly smaller.\r\nEsoteric Embellishments\r\n\r\nMr. Trump often dissembles on subjects of passing interest, like the news of the day or the parochial concerns of his local audiences. But his larger pattern of behavior still holds: These misstatements, too, accentuate the grievances of his supporters, and cast his own ideas in a more favorable light.\r\n\r\n31Senator Bernie Sanders fell victim to a rigged system with the superdelegates.\r\nSPEECHES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SEPT. 15, AND NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. 20.\r\nMr. Sanders did not lose the Democratic nomination because of superdelegates. Mrs. Clinton beat him in pledged delegates, too.\r\n",

    "text": "CLEVELAND  Avik Roy is a Republicans Republican. A health care wonk and editor at Forbes, he has worked for three Republican presidential hopefuls  Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio. Much of his adult life has been dedicated to advancing the Republican Party and conservative ideals.\r\n\r\nBut when I caught up with Roy at a bar just outside the Republican convention, he said something Ive never heard from an establishment conservative before: The Grand Old Party is going to die.\r\n\r\nI dont think the Republican Party and the conservative movement are capable of reforming themselves in an incremental and gradual way, he said. Theres going to be a disruption.\r\n\r\nRoy isnt happy about this: He believes it means the Democrats will dominate national American politics for some time. But he also believes the Republican Party has lost its right to govern, because it is driven by white nationalism rather than a true commitment to equality for all Americans.\r\n\r\nUntil the conservative movement can stand up and live by that principle, it will not have the moral authority to lead the country, he told me.\r\n\r\nThis is a standard assessment among liberals, but it is frankly shocking to hear from a prominent conservative thinker. Our conversation had the air of a confessional: of Roy admitting that he and his intellectual comrades had gone wrong, had failed, had sinned.\r\n\r\nHis history of conservatism was a Greek tragedy. It begins with a fatal error in 1964, survived on the willful self-delusion of people like Roy himself, and ended with Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nI think the conservative movement is fundamentally broken, Roy tells me. Trump is not a random act. This election is not a random act.\r\n\r\nThe conservative movements founding error: Barry Goldwater\r\n\r\nIn 1955, William F. Buckley created the intellectual architecture of modern conservatism by founding National Review, focusing on a free market, social conservatism, and a muscular foreign policy. Buckleys ideals found purchase in the Republican Party in 1964, with the nomination of Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater lost the 1964 general election, his ideas eventually won out in the GOP, culminating in the Reagan Revolution of 1980.\r\n\r\nNormally, Goldwaters defeat is spun as a story of triumph: how the conservative movement eventually righted the ship of an unprincipled GOP. But according to Roy, its the first act of a tragedy.\r\n\r\nGoldwaters nomination in 1964 was a historical disaster for the conservative movement, Roy tells me, because for the ensuing decades, it identified Democrats as the party of civil rights and Republicans as the party opposed to civil rights.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAVITATIONAL CENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS WHITE NATIONALISM\r\nGoldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He himself was not especially racist  he believed it was wrong, on free market grounds, for the federal government to force private businesses to desegregate. But this principled stance identified the GOP with the pro-segregation camp in everyones eyes, while the Democrats under Lyndon Johnson became the champions of anti-racism.\r\n\r\nThis had a double effect, Roy says. First, it forced black voters out of the GOP. Second, it invited in white racists who had previously been Democrats. Even though many Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act in Congress, the post-Goldwater party became the party of aggrieved whites.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, today, the Republican coalition has inherited the people who opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  the Southern Democrats who are now Republicans, Roy says. Conservatives and Republicans have not come to terms with that problem.\r\n\r\nConservative intellectuals were blind to the truth about the GOP  hence Trump\r\n \r\nAvik Roy (L) discusses Obamacare on television. (William B. Plowman/NBC/NBC News/Getty Images)\r\nThe available evidence compiled by historians and political scientists suggests that 1964 really was a pivotal political moment, in exactly the way Roy describes.\r\n\r\nYet Republican intellectuals have long denied this, fabricating a revisionist history in which Republicans were and always have been the party of civil rights. In 2012, National Review ran a lengthy cover story arguing that the standard history recounted by Roy was popular but indefensible.\r\n\r\nThis revisionism, according to Roy, points to a much bigger conservative delusion: They cannot admit that their partys voters are motivated far more by white identity politics than by conservative ideals.\r\n\r\nConservative intellectuals, and conservative politicians, have been in kind of a bubble, Roy says. Weve had this view that the voters were with us on conservatism  philosophical, economic conservatism. In reality, the gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism.\r\n\r\nConservative intellectuals, for the most part, are horrified by racism. When they talk about believing in individual rights and equality, they really mean it. Because the Republican Party is the vehicle through which their ideas can be implemented, they need to believe that the party isnt racist.\r\n\r\nSo they deny the partys racist history, that its post-1964 success was a direct result of attracting whites disillusioned by the Democrats embrace of civil rights. And they deny that to this day, Republican voters are driven more by white resentment than by a principled commitment to the free market and individual liberty.\r\n\r\nIts the power of wishful thinking. None of us want to accept that opposition to civil rights is the legacy that weve inherited, Roy says.\r\n\r\nHe expands on this idea: Its a common observation on the left, but its an observation that a lot of us on the right genuinely believed wasnt true  which is that conservatism has become, and has been for some time, much more about white identity politics than it has been about conservative political philosophy. I think today, even now, a lot of conservatives have not come to terms with that problem.\r\n\r\nThis, Roy believes, is where the conservative intellectual class went astray. By refusing to admit the truth about their own party, they were powerless to stop the forces that led to Donald Trumps rise. They told themselves, over and over again, that Goldwaters victory was a triumph.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, it created the conditions under which Trump could thrive. Trumps politics of aggrieved white nationalism  labeling black people criminals, Latinos rapists, and Muslims terrorists  succeeded because the partys voting base was made up of the people who once opposed civil rights.\r\n\r\n[Trump] tapped into something that was latent in the Republican Party and conservative movement  but a lot of people in the conservative movement didnt notice, Roy concludes, glumly.\r\n\r\nFor conservatism to live, the conservative movement has to die\r\n \r\nA sign with one of the RNCs most popular slogans. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Cal)\r\nOver beers, I ask Roy how he feels about all of this personally. His answer is very sad.\r\n\r\nWhen Marco [Rubio] lost, I went through the five stages of grief. It was tough. I had to spend some time thinking about what to do for the next several years of my life, he says.\r\n\r\nI left a comforting and rewarding career as a biotech investor to do this kind of work. I did it because I felt it was important, and I care about the country. Maybe its cheesy to say that, but I really sincerely do, he continues. So then, okay, what do I do? Do I do the same things Ive been doing for the last four years? To me, just to do that to collect a paycheck didnt make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nThis soul-searching led Roy to an uncomfortable conclusion: The Republican Party, and the conservative movement that propped it up, is doomed.\r\n\r\nBoth are too wedded to the politics of white nationalism to change how they act, but that just isnt a winning formula in a nation thats increasingly black and brown. Either the Republican Party will eat itself or a new party will rise and overtake its voting share.\r\n\r\nEither the disruption will come from the Republican Party representing cranky old white people and a new right-of-center party emerging in its place, or a third party will emerge,  la the Republicans emerging from the Whigs in the [1850s], Roy says.\r\n\r\nThe work of conservative intellectuals today, he argues, is to devise a new conservatism  a political vision that adheres to limited government principles but genuinely appeals to a more diverse America.\r\n\r\nI think its incredibly important to take stock, he says, and build a new conservative movement that is genuinely about individual liberty.\r\n\r\nI dont know how this would work. I dont think Roy knows either.\r\n\r\nFor the entire history of modern conservatism, its ideals have been wedded to and marred by white supremacism. Thats Roys own diagnosis, and I think its correct. As a result, we have literally no experience in America of a politically viable conservative movement unmoored from white supremacy.\r\n\r\nIve read dozens of conservative intellectuals writing compellingly about non-racist conservative ideals. Writers like Andrew Sullivan, Ross Douthat, Reihan Salam, Michael Brendan Dougherty, and too many others to count have put forward visions of a conservative party quite different from the one we have.\r\n\r\nBut not one of these writers, smart as they are, has been able to explain what actual political constituency could bring about this pure conservatism in practice. The fact is that limited government conservatism is not especially appealing to nonwhite Americans, whereas liberalism and social democracy are. The only ones for whom conservatism is a natural fit are Roys cranky old white people  and theyre dying off.\r\n\r\nMaybe Roy and company will be able to solve this problem. I hope they do. America needs a viable, intellectually serious right-of-center party.\r\n\r\nBecause we now know what the alternative looks like. Its Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nWatch: How the Republican Party went from Lincoln to Trump",

    "text": "On Sunday's Last Week Tonight, John Oliver finally took on billionaire Donald Trump.\r\n\r\n\"I get that the character of Donald Trump is entertaining, and that he says things that people want to hear,\" Oliver said. \"And I know that his very name is powerful.\"\r\n\r\nBut Oliver argued that Trump isn't what he seems. Here are some of the qualities many supporters have listed about Trump  and Oliver's counterpoints:\r\n\r\n\"He tells it like it is\": \"Does he? Because the website PolitiFact checked 77 of his statements, and rated 76 percent of them as varying degrees of false.\"\r\n\"He is truly independent and not beholden to anyone\": \"While it is true that he hasn't taken corporate money, the implication that he has personally spent $20 to $25 million is a bit of a stretch, because what he's actually done is loaned his own campaign $17.5 million and has just personally given just $250,000. And that's important, because up until the convention he can pay himself back for the loan with campaign funds.\"\r\n\"He's tough\": \"For a tough guy, he has incredibly thin skin. Back in 1988, Spy magazine called him a short-fingered vulgarian. And ever since, the editor Graydon Carter says he receives envelopes from Trump, always with a photo on which he circled his hand to highlight the length of his fingers, usually with a note reading, 'See, not so short!'\"\r\n\"His success\": \"While yes, he has made more money than most of us will make in a lifetime, not only did he get a multimillion-dollar inheritance from his father, but he's also lost a huge amount.\" \r\n\r\nOliver then played a clip of Trump's daughter saying, \"I remember once my father and I were walking down Fifth Avenue and there was a homeless person sitting right outside of Trump Tower. And I remember my father pointing to him and saying, 'You know, that guy has $8 billion more than me.' Because he was in such extreme debt at that point.\"\r\nOliver also noted one other issue with Trump: He's wildly inconsistent. \"He's been pro-choice and pro-life, for and against assault weapon bans, in favor of both bringing in Syrian refugees and deporting them out of the country.\"\r\n\r\nOr take Trump's inconsistent statements on former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke's endorsement of Trump. To CNN, Trump said, \"I don't know anything about David Duke. Okay? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists.\"\r\n\r\nOliver was not having it, pointing to Trump's past remarks to journalists: \"Really? That's your best answer there? Because you definitely know who he is  partly because you called him 'a bigot' and 'a racist' in the past.\"\r\n\r\nOliver concluded that the best way to take down Trump is to uncouple him from his brand  his name. And it turns out that the Trump family's name was once Drumpf. Oliver explained how this could work:\r\n\r\nIf you are thinking of voting for Donald Trump, the charismatic guy promising to make America great again, stop and take a moment to imagine how you would feel if you just met a guy named Donald Drumpf, a litigious serial liar with a string of broken business ventures and the support of a former Klan leader who he can't decide whether or not to condemn. Would you think he would make a good president, or is the spell now somewhat broken?\r\n\"That is why tonight I am asking America to make Donald Drumpf again,\" Oliver added.\r\n\r\nOliver then announced the launch of the #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain and the website DonaldJDrumpf.com, where anyone can download a browser extension that replaces Trump's name with Drumpf.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot keep getting blinded by the magic of his name,\" Oliver said. \"So please, don't think of him as Donald Trump. Think of him as something else.\"",

    "text": "DONT go anywhere near a mosque, I told my mother. Do all your prayer at home. O.K.?\r\n\r\nWere not going, she replied.\r\n\r\nI am the son of Muslim immigrants. As I sent that text, in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Orlando, Fla., I realized how awful it was to tell an American citizen to be careful about how she worshiped.\r\n\r\nBeing Muslim American already carries a decent amount of baggage. In our culture, when people think Muslim, the picture in their heads is not usually of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or the kid who left the boy band One Direction. Its of a scary terrorist character from Homeland or some monster from the news.\r\n\r\nToday, with the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels. Its visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense.\r\n\r\nAziz Ansaris parents, Fatima and Shoukath Ansari Credit Photo courtesy Aziz Ansari\r\nThere are approximately 3.3 million Muslim Americans. After the attack in Orlando, The Times reported that the F.B.I. is investigating 1,000 potential homegrown violent extremists, a majority of whom are most likely connected in some way to the Islamic State. If everyone on that list is Muslim American, that is 0.03 percent of the Muslim American population. If you round that number, it is 0 percent. The overwhelming number of Muslim Americans have as much in common with that monster in Orlando as any white person has with any of the white terrorists who shoot up movie theaters or schools or abortion clinics.\r\n\r\nI asked a young friend of mine, a woman in her 20s of Muslim heritage, how she had been feeling after the attack. I just feel really bad, like people think I have more in common with that idiot psychopath than I do the innocent people being killed, she said. Im really sick of having to explain that Im not a terrorist every time the shooter is brown.\r\n\r\nI myself am not a religious person, but after these attacks, anyone that even looks like they might be Muslim understands the feelings my friend described. There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone else.\r\n\r\nI understand that as far as these problems go, I have it better than most because of my recognizability as an actor. When someone on the street gives me a strange look, its usually because they want to take a selfie with me, not that they think Im a terrorist.\r\n\r\nBut I remember how those encounters can feel. A few months after the attacks of Sept. 11, I remember walking home from class near N.Y.U., where I was a student. I was crossing the street and a man swore at me from his car window and yelled: Terrorist! To be fair, I may have been too quick to cross the street as the light changed, but Im not sure that warranted being compared to the perpetrators of one of the most awful incidents in human history.\r\n\r\nThe vitriolic and hate-filled rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump isnt so far off from cursing at strangers from a car window. He has said that people in the American Muslim community know who the bad ones are, implying that millions of innocent people are somehow complicit in awful attacks. Not only is this wrongheaded; but it also does nothing to address the real problems posed by terrorist attacks. By Mr. Trumps logic, after the huge financial crisis of 2007-08, the best way to protect the American economy would have been to ban white males.\r\n\r\nAccording to reporting by Mother Jones, since 9/11, there have been 49 mass shootings in this country, and more than half of those were perpetrated by white males. I doubt well hear Mr. Trump make a speech asking his fellow white males to tell authorities who the bad ones are, or call for restricting white males freedoms.\r\n\r\nOne way to decrease the risk of terrorism is clear: Keep military-grade weaponry out of the hands of mentally unstable people, those with a history of violence, and those on F.B.I. watch lists. But, despite sit-ins and filibusters, our lawmakers are failing us on this front and choose instead to side with the National Rifle Association. Suspected terrorists can buy assault rifles, but were still carrying tiny bottles of shampoo to the airport. If were going to use the theyll just find another way argument, lets use that to let us keep our shoes on.\r\n\r\nXenophobic rhetoric was central to Mr. Trumps campaign long before the attack in Orlando. This is a guy who kicked off his presidential run by calling Mexicans rapists who were bringing drugs to this country. Numerous times, he has said that Muslims in New Jersey were cheering in the streets on Sept. 11, 2001. This has been continually disproved, but he stands by it. I dont know what every Muslim American was doing that day, but I can tell you what my family was doing. I was studying at N.Y.U., and I lived near the World Trade Center. When the second plane hit, I was on the phone with my mother, who called to tell me to leave my dorm building.\r\n\r\nThe haunting sound of the second plane hitting the towers is forever ingrained in my head. My building was close enough that it shook upon impact. I was scared for my life as my fellow students and I trekked the panicked streets of Manhattan. My family, unable to reach me on my cellphone, was terrified about my safety as they watched the towers collapse. There was absolutely no cheering. Only sadness, horror and fear.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump, in response to the attack in Orlando, began a tweet with these words: Appreciate the congrats. It appears that day he was the one who was celebrating after an attack.\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "Don't expect to see Donald Trump give a humble concession speech if he loses the Republican presidential nomination.\r\n\r\nDuring a Sunday rally in Maryland, the Republican presidential frontrunner mocked candidates who praise their opponents during concession speeches, saying that if he loses the contest, Americans will probably not hear much from him again.\r\n\r\n\"They fight like hell for six months, and they're saying horrible things, the worst things you can imagine,\" Trump said. \"And then one of them loses, one of them wins. And the one who loses says, 'I just want to congratulate my opponent. He is a brilliant man, he'll be a great governor or president or whatever.'\"\r\n\r\nHe continued: \"I'm not sure you're ever going to see me there. I don't think I'm going to lose, but if I do, I don't think you're ever going to see me again, folks. I think I'll go to Turnberry and play golf or something.\"\r\n\r\nTrump's mockery wasn't relegated just to the electoral losers. He also said Sunday that the winners were too modest.\r\n\r\n\"Half the times [the winners] put them in the administration  that's how they get rid of them,\" Trump said of the losing candidates.\r\n\r\nThis line of thought has not stopped Trump from graciously accepting endorsements from other candidates who have dropped out of the presidential race. Trump frequently touts his support from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\r\n\r\nDuring a news conference in February announcing Christie's endorsement, Trump lauded Christie's tenure as a governor and his barbs during the Republican presidential debates.\r\n\r\n\"Generally speaking, I'm not big on endorsements,\" Trump said, adding, \"This was an endorsement that really meant a lot.\"",

    "text": "Tonight, Donald J. Trump accepted the Republican Partys nomination for president of the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd I am, for the first time since I began covering American politics, genuinely afraid.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump is not a man who should be president. This is not an ideological judgment. This is not something I would say about Mitt Romney or Marco Rubio. This is not a disagreement over Donald Trumps tax plan or his climate policies. This is about Trumps character, his temperament, his impulsiveness, his basic decency.\r\n\r\nBack in February, I wrote that Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory. He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament; he's a racist, a sexist, and a demagogue, but he's also a narcissist, a bully, and a dilettante. He lies so constantly and so fluently that it's hard to know if he even realizes he's lying. He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash.\r\n\r\nHe has had plenty of time to prove me, and everyone else, wrong. But he hasnt. He has not become more responsible or more sober, more decent or more generous, more considered or more informed, more careful or more kind. He has continued to retweet white supremacists, make racist comments, pick unnecessary fights, contradict himself on the stump, and show an almost gleeful disinterest in building a real campaign or learning about policy.\r\n\r\nHe has, instead, run a campaign based on stoking fear and playing to resentment. His speech tonight invoked a nightmarish American hellscape that doesn't actually exist. His promise to restore order made him sound like the aspiring strongman his critics fear him to be. \"I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end,\" he said. \"Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.\"\r\n\r\nHere is what we know  truly know  about Trump. Here is why he should not be president.\r\n\r\nTrump is vindictive. So far, the unifying theme of Trumps convention is that the leader of the opposition party should be thrown in jail. Trump didnt like the Washington Posts coverage of his campaign, so he barred its reporters from his rallies and threatened to use the power of the presidency to bring an antitrust suit against the Post's owner, Jeff Bezos.\r\n\r\nHe was upset that Ohio didnt vote for him, so he sat its delegation in the cheap seats, even though the state is hosting the convention. He was angry about an interview his ex-ghostwriter gave to the New Yorker, so he sent his lawyers after him. He hates the protesters who interrupt his campaigns, so he said he would look into paying the legal fees of a supporter who sucker-punched one of them.\r\n\r\nImagine Donald Trump with the powers of the presidency. Imagine what he could do  what he would do  to those who crossed him.\r\n\r\nTrump is a bigot. Donald Trump kicked off his campaign calling Mexican immigrants murderers and rapists. He responded to Ted Cruzs surge in Iowa by calling for a ban on Muslim travel. He sought to discredit a US-born judge by saying his rulings were suspect because of his \"Mexican heritage.\" Trumps campaign is certainly the first time in my memory that a sitting speaker of the House has had to describe something his partys nominee said as \"the textbook definition of a racist comment.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not a man who should be put in charge of an increasingly diverse country that needs to find allies in an increasingly diverse world.\r\n\r\nTrump is a sexist. Stories of Trumps casual sexism abound, but during the campaign, it was women who questioned him who felt the full force of his misogyny. The first Republican debate, for instance, was hosted by Fox News and moderated by Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier, and Chris Wallace. Kelly wasnt obviously tougher on Trump than her colleagues, but she was the antagonist he focused on, retweeting a follower who said she was \"a bimbo\" and saying she had \"blood coming out of her  wherever.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Carly Fiorina challenged him in a debate, Trump said to Rolling Stone, \"Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\" After Hillary Clinton needed to take a bathroom break during a debate, Trump told the crowd, \"It's too disgusting. Don't say it, it's disgusting.\"\r\n\r\nIts not just during political campaigns that this side of Trump emerges. Trump once told his friend Philip Johnson that the secret to women was \"[y]ou have to treat 'em like shit.\"\r\n\r\nTrump is a liar. Trump boasts constantly that he had the judgment and foresight to oppose the Iraq War. But he didnt. On September 11, 2002, Trump was asked by Howard Stern whether he supported the invasion of Iraq. \"Yeah, I guess so,\" he replied. Trump has not sought to explain these comments or offer evidence of an alternative judgment he offered elsewhere. He just lies about this, and he does so often.\r\n\r\nBut thats true for Trump across many issues. He says his health care plan will insure everyone, when it will do nothing of the kind. He says his tax plan raises taxes on the wealthy when it actually cuts them sharply. Trump has lied about his net worth, his reasons for not releasing his tax returns, and his charitable donations. He lies easily, fluently, shamelessly, constantly.\r\n\r\nTrump is a narcissist. Trumps towering self-regard worked for him as a real estate developer. His real business was licensing his name out for building, menswear, golf courses, steaks. A bit of a narcissism is necessary to become a global brand. But the trait is maladaptive in a presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nThe most recent example was the 28 minutes he spent talking about himself when he was supposed to be introducing Mike Pence, his vice presidential candidate, for the first time. The most grotesque example was when he responded to the deadliest mass shooting in American history by tweeting, \"Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.\"\r\n\r\nTrump admires authoritarian dictators for their authoritarianism. When MSNBC's Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin, who \"kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries,\" Trump replied, \"He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country.\"\r\n\r\nBut its not just Putin. Trump has praised Saddam Hussein because \"he killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights.\" He said \"you've got to give [Kim Jong Un] credit. He goes in, he takes over, and he's the boss. It's incredible.\" Its not just that Trump admires these authoritarians; its that the thing he admires about them is their authoritarianism  their ability to dispense with niceties like a free press, due process, and political opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrump is a conspiracy theorist. Trump burst onto the scene as a leader of the absurd \"birther\" movement. Hes said that Bill Ayers is the real author of Barack Obamas Dreams From My Father, explained that the unemployment rate in America is really over 40 percent, and suggested that both Antonin Scalia and Vince Foster were murdered.\r\n\r\nTrump is very, very gullible. This is related to his conspiracy theories, but Trump has a habit of believing and retweeting bad information that sounds good to him at the time.\r\n\r\nThis has led to, among other things, Trump retweeting false crime statistics, Trump retweeting Mussolini quotes from a Twitter account called Il Duce, Trump promoting a fake video claiming a protester who rushed his stage was sent by ISIS, and Trump endorsing a National Enquirer report suggesting Ted Cruzs dad helped kill JFK. When pressed about these sundry embarrassments, Trump said, \"All I know is whats on the internet.\"\r\n\r\nThats a reasonable response from your uncle who forwards you weird email chains, but not from a presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nTrump doesnt apologize, and his defensiveness escalates situations. On Monday night, it became very clear that Melania Trumps 2016 convention speech had lifted two paragraphs from Michelle Obamas 2008 convention speech. The error was an embarrassment, but it could have been dispatched quickly by simply admitting fault and apologizing.\r\n\r\nInstead, the Trump campaign turned it into a multi-day story and a character issue by denying anything had happened and blaming Hillary Clinton. This is \"an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, how she seeks out to demean her and take her down,\" said campaign chair Paul Manafort, in one of the most genuinely ridiculous comments in recent American history.\r\n\r\nThe campaign also tried to argue that Michelle Obama doesnt own the English language, and that similar language was used by Twilight Sparkle, a My Little Pony (Im serious). Finally, days later, the Trump campaign admitted there was plagiarism and blamed a miscommunication between Melania and her speechwriter.\r\n\r\nA similar pattern played out when Trump tweeted an anti-Hillary meme that superimposed a Star of David atop a pile of money and accused Clinton of corruption. The image was obviously anti-Semitic, and the Trump campaign quickly took it down. But Trump himself went on a Twitter rampage, arguing that what was clearly a Star of David was actually just a sheriffs star, or maybe just a regular old star, and that the campaign shouldnt have removed the offending meme in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo far, these examples are farce, but as Tim Lee writes, this tendency in the Oval Office could lead to tragedy: \"[Trumps] behavior on the campaign trail suggests that he would be unlikely to admit mistakes and defuse tense situations. Instead, his first instinct would be to escalate every conflict in an effort to bully foreign adversaries into giving him his way. That might work in some cases. But in others  especially against powerful countries like China or Russia  the results could be disastrous.\"\r\n\r\nTrump surrounds himself with sycophants. It's tradition for presidential candidates to release a note from their physician testifying to their fitness to fulfill the duties of the presidency. On December 14, Donald Trump submitted his entry to this quadrennial custom.\r\n\r\n\"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,\" Dr. Harold Bornstein writes. \"His blood pressure, 110/65, and laboratory test results were astonishingly excellent.  His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary.\"\r\n\r\nThis is  not how most doctor notes read. \"Reached for comment regarding this, a spokesperson at the American Medical Association just giggled,\" reported the Daily Beast.\r\n\r\nThere are many positions where one might accept a pliable crony. But \"personal physician\" should not be one of them. The fact that Trump would entrust his health to a doctor who would sign off on a note like this should terrify his family and friends. But more than that, it should disqualify him from the presidency.\r\n\r\nTrump has proven too lazy to learn about policy. Trump didnt know much about policy when the campaign started, and as far as anyone can tell, he hasnt made any obvious effort to rectify that.\r\n\r\nThe latest and most damaging example is his interview with the New York Times, in which he said he would not automatically defend NATO countries against attack from Russia. Its not obvious Trump meant to say that, or even knew what saying that meant, as Manafort immediately began denying Trump had ever said it. (The Times subsequently released a transcript showing that, yes, Trump had said it.)\r\n\r\nBut this is a pattern for Trump, who doesnt bother to come up with convincing answers even to obvious questions, and definitely has not put in the time to develop a deep understanding of the issues he might face as president. As Matt Yglesias wrote, this is very much a choice Trump has made. \"Trump is now the GOP nominee, and there are hundreds of professional Republican Party politicians and operatives around the country who would gladly help him become a sharper, better-informed candidate. It doesnt happen because he cant be bothered.\"\r\n\r\nTrump has run an incompetent campaign and convention. As brilliant as Trump has been in securing media attention for himself and channeling the anxieties of conservative voters, he hasnt bothered to build a real campaign organization, and his convention has been a festival of unforced errors.\r\n\r\nThis is the context of Melania Trumps plagiarism, of Ted Cruzs anti-endorsement, of the night that was supposed to be about jobs and the economy but was actually about Benghazi and jailing Hillary Clinton. In isolation, these are gaffes, mistakes, bad luck. Together, though, they tell a damning story of organizational incompetence.\r\n\r\nThe most generous interpretation of this is that Trump is capable of running an effective organization, but hes just not interested in conventions and field operations in the way he is interested in golf courses and condos. Others have certainly testified to the trouble Trump has focusing on tasks that dont engage him. His former ghostwriter says, \"He has no attention span.\" Unfortunately, the president actually needs to focus on all kinds of dull and unpleasant tasks.\r\n\r\nTrump is a bully. Trump won the Republican nomination by proving that even adults can be bullied with schoolyard taunts. There was \"low-energy Jeb,\" and \"Little Marco,\" and \"Lyin Ted,\" and now weve got \"Crooked Hillary.\" Trump made fun of Rand Pauls looks and Chris Christies weight and Carly Fiorinas face and a New York Times reporters physical disability.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this shouldnt have to be said, but its better to be kind than cruel, and theres a deep, instinctual cruelty in Trump  he finds peoples weak spots, their insecurities, and he exposes them in front of crowds.\r\n\r\nTrump has regularly incited or justified violence among his supporters. At a rally in St. Louis, Donald Trump lamented that \"nobody wants to hurt each other anymore.\"\r\n\r\nYes, lamented.\r\n\r\nThe topic was protesters, and Trump's frustration was clear. \"They're being politically correct the way they take them out,\" he sighed. \"Protesters, they realize there are no consequences to protesting anymore. There used to be consequences. There are none anymore.\"\r\n\r\nEarlier in the campaign, two of Trumps supporters attacked a homeless Mexican man and told the police, \"Donald Trump was right  all these illegals need to be deported.\" Trumps response? \"I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again.\"\r\n\r\nThe simple fact of it is that Donald Trump should not be president of the United States. That is not because he is too conservative, as some Democrats would have it, or because he is not conservative enough, as many Republicans would have it. Its because the presidency is a powerful job where mistakes can kill millions, and whoever holds it needs to take that power seriously and wield it responsibly. Trump has had ample opportunity to demonstrate his sense of seriousness and responsibility. He has failed.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the benefit of Americas long presidential campaigns is they offer the candidates time to show us who they really are. Trump has shown us who he really is. He is a person who should not be president. That he is being brought this close to the presidency  that he is one major mistake by Hillary Clinton away from winning it  should scare us all. It certainly scares me.",

    "text": "We are really ready for this presidential election to be over. Were ready for an end to the rancor and tackiness.\r\n\r\nVoters on both sides feel frustrated, even embarrassed by it all. There is a visceral fear, an angst about the result. What if so and so wins? When we wake up to November 9, post-election, when the confetti is swept away and the election is finally over, what will we see?\r\n\r\nI have a prediction. I know exactly what November 9 will bring. Another day of Gods perfect sovereignty.\r\n\r\nHe will still be in charge. His throne will still be occupied. He will still manage the affairs of the world. Never before has His providence depended on a king, president, or ruler. And it wont on November 9, 2016. The LORD can control a kings mind as he controls a river; he can direct it as he pleases (Proverbs 21:1 NCV).\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the Lord turned the heart of the King of Assyria so that he aided them in the construction of the Temple.  On another occasion, he stirred the heart of Cyrus to release the Jews to return to Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar was considered to be the mightiest king of his generation. But God humbled and put him in detention for seven years.  The kingdom is the Lords, and He rules over the nations (Psalms 22:28).\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Gods sovereignty over the nations opens the door to peace. When we realize that God influences the hearts of all rulers, we can then choose to pray for them rather than fret about them. Rather than wring our hands we bend our knees, we select prayer over despair.             \r\n\r\nJeremiah did this. He was the prophet to Israel during one of her darkest periods of rebellion. He was called the weeping prophet because he was one. He wept at the condition of the people and the depravity of their faith. He was so distraught that one of his books was entitled Lamentations. But then he considered the work of God. Note the intentionality of his words:\r\n\r\nThis I recall to my mind,\r\n\r\nTherefore I have hope.\r\n\r\nThe LORDs lovingkindnesses indeed never cease,\r\n\r\nFor His compassions never fail.\r\n\r\nThey are new every morning;\r\n\r\nGreat is Your faithfulness.\r\n\r\n(Lam. 3:21-23)\r\n\r\nImitate Jeremiah. Lift up your eyes. Dare to believe that good things will happen. Dare to believe that God was speaking to us when he said: In everything God works for the good of those who love him (Romans 8:28).\r\n\r\nMany years ago, I spent a week visiting the interior of Brazil with a long-time missionary pilot. He flew a circuit of remote towns in a small plane that threatened to come undone at the slightest gust of wind. Wilbur and Orville had a sturdier aircraft.\r\n\r\nI could not get comfortable. I kept thinking that the plane was going to crash in some Brazilian jungle and Id be gobbled up by piranhas or swallowed by an anaconda.\r\n\r\nI kept shifting around, looking down, and gripping my seat. (As if that would help.) Finally, the pilot had had enough of my squirming. He looked at me and shouted over the airplane noise. We wont face anything I cant handle. You might as well trust me to fly the plane.\r\n\r\nIs God saying the same to you? If so, make this your prayer:\r\n\r\nDear Lord,\r\n\r\nYou are perfect. You could not be better than you are.\r\n\r\nYou are self-created. You exist because you choose to exist.\r\n\r\nYou are self-sustaining. No one helps you. No one gives you strength.\r\n\r\nYou are self-governing. Who can question your deeds? Who dares advise you?\r\n\r\nYou are correct. In every way. In every choice. You regret no decision.\r\n\r\nYou have never failed. Never! You cannot fail! You are God! You will accomplish your plan.\r\n\r\nYou are happy. Eternally joyful. Endlessly content.\r\n\r\nYou are the king, supreme ruler, absolute monarch, overlord, and rajah of all history.\r\n\r\nAn arch of your eyebrow and a million angels will pivot and salute. Every throne is a footstool to yours. Every crown is papiermch to yours. No limitations, hesitations, questions, second thoughts, or backward glances. You consult no clock. You keep no calendar. You report to no one. You are in charge.\r\n\r\nAnd I trust you.\r\n\r\nCircle November 9 on your calendar and write upon it the words: Our good God rules the world.",

    "text": "An anonymous Jane Doe filed a federal lawsuit against GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump last week, accusing him of raping her in 1994 when she was thirteen years old. The mainstream media ignored the filing.\r\n\r\nIf the Bill Cosby case has taught us anything, it is to not disregard rape cases against famous men. Serious journalists have publicly apologized for turning a blind eye to the Cosby accusers for over a decade, notwithstanding the large number of women who had come forward with credible claims. And now history is repeating itself.\r\n\r\nIn covering a story, a media outlet is not finding guilt. It is simply reporting the news that a lawsuit has been filed against Mr. Trump, and ideally putting the complaint in context. Unproven allegations are just that - unproven, and should be identified that way. (Mr. Trumps lawyer says the charges are categorically untrue, completely fabricated and politically motivated.) Proof comes later, at trial. But the November election will come well before any trial. And while Mr. Trump is presumed innocent, we are permitted  no, we are obligated  to analyze the cases viability now.\r\n\r\nNo outsider can say whether Mr. Trump is innocent or guilty of these new rape charges. But we can look at his record, analyze the court filings here, and make a determination as to credibility  whether the allegations are believable enough for us to take them seriously and investigate them, keeping in mind his denial and reporting new facts as they develop.\r\n\r\nI have done that. And the answer is a clear yes. These allegations are credible. They ought not be ignored. Mainstream media, Im looking at you.\r\n\r\n1. Consider the context: Mr. Trumps overt, even proud misogyny.\r\n\r\nThe rape case must be viewed through the lens of Mr. Trumps current, longstanding and well documented contempt for women. Men who objectify women are more likely to become perpetrators of sexual violence, just as one with a long history of overtly racist comments is more likely to commit a hate crime.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump has relished calling women dogs, slobs and pigs, and cyberstalked and derided journalist Megyn Kelly for having the temerity to ask him to defend his own words. He threw out the most misogynist of attacks, attempting to undermine her professionalism by accusing her of menstruating. Hes cruelly ridiculed the appearance of a female opponent (Carly Fiorina) and an opponents wife (Heidi Cruz). His campaign even openly acknowledged that it disqualified all women for consideration as his vice-president.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump has a long history of debasing women hes worked with, crossing the line on a regular basis. Hes taken lifelong joy in objectifying women, including his proclamation: Women, you have to treat em like shit.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be ignored. Decades of abusive language does not make him a rapist. But it does show us who the man is: a callous, meanspirited misogynist who no sane person would leave alone with her daughter. As Dr. Maya Angelou said, When someone shows you who they really are, believe them.\r\n\r\n2. More context: two prior sexual assault court claims have been made against Mr. Trump.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Trump has been accused of worse than just misogynist language. Two prior women have accused Mr. Trump, in court documents, of actual or attempted sexual assault. (Mr. Trump denies all the allegations.)\r\n\r\nUnder oath, Ivana Trump accused Mr. Trump of a violent rape.\r\n\r\nFirst was Ivana Trump, Donald Trumps first wife, who said under oath in a 1989 deposition that he had violently attacked her, ripped out her hair and forcibly penetrated her without her consent. According to the Daily Beast, she claims he was wildly angry that shed referred him to a cosmetic surgeon who had botched a scalp reduction job (to cover a bald spot) and caused pain in his scalp - hence the vindictive yanking on her hair. At the time Ms. Trump said she felt violated by the alleged rape.\r\n\r\nA few years later, after their divorce was settled, Ms. Trump claimed that she did not mean the word rape in a literal or criminal sense.\r\n\r\nNote: virtually every settlement of a case involving a high profile person paying money to a former spouse - or anyone - requires the person receiving the money to agree in writing to ironclad nondisparagement and confidentiality. In plain English: you promise to be quiet and not say anything bad about the party paying you money. This has been the case in hundreds of settlement agreements I have worked on over the years. Ms. Trump was almost certainly contractually prohibited after she signed from saying anything negative about Mr. Trump. And it is also common to attempt to cure prior negative statements with new agreed-to language - like, I didnt mean it literally. (You didnt mean forcible penetration literally?)\r\n\r\nA business acquaintance accused Mr. Trump of sexual harassment and attempted rape.\r\n\r\nA second woman accused Donald Trump of sexual assault, in 1997. According to The Guardian, then 34-year-old Jill Harth alleged in a federal lawsuit that Trump violated her physical and mental integrity when he touched her intimately without consent after her husband went into business with him, leaving her emotionally devastated [and] distraught. The lawsuit called the multiple acts attempted rape. Shortly thereafter she voluntarily withdrew the case when a parallel suit against Mr. Trump brought by her husband was settled. When The Guardian reached the woman in 2016 to ask whether she stood by her sexual assault allegations, she responded, yes.\r\n\r\nIn a court filing, according to a report, Ms. Harth alleged that while she and her husband were trying to do a business deal with Mr. Trump regarding a beauty pageant, he repeatedly propositioned her for sex and groped her, culminating in this frightening alleged incident:\r\n\r\nTrump forcefully removed (Harth) from public areas of Mar-A-Lago in Florida and forced (her) into a bedroom belonging to defendants daughter Ivanka, wherein (Trump) forcibly kissed, fondled, and restrained (her) from leaving, against (her) will and despite her protests. In the court document, she said that Trump bragged that he would be the best lover you ever have.\r\n\r\nRecently Donald Trump issued a statement that womens claims of sexual harassment, documented in a lengthy New York Times investigation which included Ms. Harths lawsuit, were made up.\r\n\r\nJill Harth responded angrily on Twitter last week: My part was true. I didnt talk. As usual you opened your big mouth. \r\n\r\nIn other words, she is standing by her story.\r\n\r\n3. The new Jane Doe child rape claim against Mr. Trump is consistent with verifiable facts about Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein, and has a powerful witness statement attached to it.\r\n\r\nA third woman accused Mr. Trump of rape very recently. According to the Daily Mail, a woman filed an April 2016 lawsuit claiming that when she was thirteen years old she was held as a sex slave to Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein. The woman claimed to have a witness, Tiffany Doe, to the incidents. She filed the case in pro per, that is, without the assistance of a lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe case was dismissed by the court for technical filing errors. She then obtained a lawyer and the case was modified and refiled in New York federal court, against Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein.\r\n\r\nIve carefully reviewed this federal complaint. It is now much stronger than the one she filed on her own, which makes sense because she now has an experienced litigator representing her. Jane Doe says that as a 13-year-old, she was enticed to attend parties at the home of Jeffrey Epstein with the promise of money modeling jobs. Mr. Epstein is a notorious billionaire pedophile who is now a Level 3 registered sex offender  the most dangerous kind, a threat to public safety  after being convicted of misconduct with another underage girl.\r\n\r\nJane Doe says that Mr. Trump initiated sexual contact with her on four occasions in 1994. Since she was thirteen at the time, consent is not an issue. If Mr. Trump had any type of sexual contact with her in 1994, it was a crime.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth incident, she says Mr. Trump tied her to a bed and forcibly raped her, in a savage sexual attack, while she pleaded with him to stop. She says Mr. Trump violently struck her in the face. She says that afterward, if she ever revealed what he had done, Mr. Trump threatened that she and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. She says she has been in fear of him ever since.\r\n\r\nNew Yorks five year statute of limitations on this claim  the legal deadline for filing  has long since run. However, Jane Does attorney, Thomas Meagher, argues in his court filing that because she was threatened by Mr. Trump, she has been under duress all this time, and therefore she should be permitted additional time to come forward. Legally, this is calling tolling  stopping the clock, allowing more time to file the case. As a result, the complaint alleges, Jane Doe did not have freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time. He cites two New York cases which I have read and which do support tolling\r\n\r\nTwo unusual documents are attached to Jane Does complaints  sworn declarations attesting to the facts. The first is from Jane Doe herself, telling her horrific story, including the allegation that Jeffrey Epstein also raped her and threatened her into silence, and this stunner:\r\n\r\nDefendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump . . .\r\n\r\nAnd this one:\r\n\r\nDefendant Trump stated that I shouldnt ever say anything if I didnt want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having my whole family killed.\r\n\r\nThe second declaration is even more astonishing, because it is signed by Tiffany Doe, Mr. Epsteins party planner from 1991-2000. Tiffany Doe says that her duties were to get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties. (Adolescents are, legally, children.\r\n\r\nTiffany Doe says that she recruited Jane Doe at the Port Authority in New York, persuaded her to attend Mr. Epsteins parties, and actually witnessed the sexual assaults on Jane Doe:\r\n\r\nI personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness. But Tiffany Doe says:\r\n\r\nI personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop.\r\n\r\nTiffany Doe corroborates, based on her own personal observations, just about everything in Jane Does complaint: that 12-year-old Maria was involved in a sex act with Mr. Trump, that Mr. Trump threatened the life of Jane Doe if she ever revealed what happened, and that she would disappear like Maria if she did.\r\n\r\nTiffany Doe herself says that she is in mortal fear of Mr. Trump to this day:\r\nI am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that I personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein . . . I swear to these facts under the penalty for perjury even though I fully understand that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger.\r\n\r\nGiven all this, and based on the record thus far, Jane Does claims appear credible. Mr. Epsteins own sexual crimes and parties with underage girls are well documented, as is Mr. Trumps relationship with him two decades ago in New York City. Mr. Trump told a reporter a few years ago: Ive known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. Hes a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\r\n\r\nPowerfully, Jane Doe appears to have an eyewitness to all aspects of her claim, a witness who appears to have put herself in substantial danger by coming forward, because at a minimum Mr. Epstein knows her true identity.\r\n\r\nJane Doe has not granted any interviews, and we dont know anything about her background, or Tiffany Does, or the details of their stories. Much information needs to be revealed to fully assess this case. Perhaps they will be discredited on cross-examination. Perhaps they will recant. But if were going to speculate in that direction, we should speculate in the other direction as well. Perhaps Jane Doe and her lawyer will have more evidence and witnesses to corroborate her claim. Perhaps witnesses from Mr. Epsteins notorious parties will come forward. We just cant know any of that at this point.\r\n\r\nBut based on what we do know now, Jane Does claims fall squarely into the long, ugly context of Mr. Trumps life of misogyny, are consistent with prior sexual misconduct claims, are backed up by an eyewitness, and thus should be taken seriously. Her claims merit sober consideration and investigation.\r\n\r\nWe live in a world where wealthy, powerful men often use and abuse women and girls. While these allegations may shock some, as a lawyer who represents women in sexual abuse cases every day, I can tell you that sadly, they are common, as is an accusers desire to remain anonymous, and her terror in coming forward.\r\n\r\nWhat do you call a nation that refuses to even look at sexual assault claims against a man seeking to lead the free world?\r\n\r\nRape culture.\r\n\r\nWe ignore the voices of women at our peril.",

    "text": "Its impossible to miss the Hillary for Prison signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. Oh for goodness  that is not going to happen, she said. Im not even going to answer that question.\r\n\r\nBased on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times-CBS poll found that 40% of Democrats say she cannot be trusted.\r\n\r\nFor decades shes been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as a congenital liar and accused of covering up her husbands misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the Hillary is a liar videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or zone of privacy that she protects too fiercely. Its a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny shes attracted, more than any male politician I can think of.\r\n\r\nI would be dead rich, to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours Ive spent covering just about every scandal that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor Ive launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. Im not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising.\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\r\n\r\nThe yardsticks I use for measuring a politicians honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, Ive looked for connections between money (including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties) and official actions. Im on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election.\r\n\r\nThe connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up raising serious questions about potential conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor.\r\n\r\nAs for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth-telling record of any of the 2016 presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest pants on fire rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. (He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as 35%).\r\n\r\n\r\nI can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABCs George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret.\r\n\r\nThe same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne (politicians always praise their hosts), so why not release them?\r\n\r\nColin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvards Institute of Politics, thinks a gender-related double standard gets applied to Clinton. We expect purity from women candidates, he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, its seen as dishonest, he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersings point when he asked Clinton: Have you always told the truth? She gave an honest response, Ive always tried to, always. Always. Pelley said she was leaving wiggle room. What politician wouldnt?\r\n\r\nClinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons private life. The distrust continues.\r\n\r\nThese are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesnt have rhino hide, and during her husbands first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical (and excellent) investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike most politicians, shes switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in 2007 that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals.\r\n\r\nStill, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest.\r\n\r\nIts fair to expect more transparency. But its a double standard to insist on her purity.",

    "text": "m cool with you removing me from your friends list if you dont like this post. You can even disown me if you like. But Donald Trump isnt a good person, nor would he be a good president. I can understand a difference in politics. I can understand if you dont like a government run by Democrats. I can understand if you dont like certain ideologies, like Socialism. But I cant understand why you would support someone as hateful, sexist, racist and ignorant as Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nHow do you support him so blindly? Ask yourself, are you a racist, sexist, hateful and ignorant person as well? I hear his supporters saying they like him because he tells the truth, because hes so rich he can say whatever he feels like with no apologies. Just because Trump is saying these things doesnt suddenly make them right. Its not okay to discriminate against an entire religion based on a small percentage of its followers who have become terrorists by twisting the words of the religion to fit their crazy ideals. Its not okay to marginalize an entire race of people, saying things like all the Mexicans are lazy, that they are all stealing our jobs and bringing drugs into our country.\r\n\r\nWhite people also have bad apples. So does every race of people. Were all human. Some humans are really bad people. Some are really good. And it doesnt matter what color they are, it makes no difference whatsoever. Trump says he is just telling the truth. But whose truth? There are lazy people in every race and there are dangerous violent people in every race and every religion. Kicking all Muslims out of the country is not the answer, nor is it the acceptable behavior of a person in an extremely powerful position, like the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Internment camps were wrong, Segregation was wrong, Slavery was wrong. We fought wars amongst ourselves to rise above racism and hatred. In WWII more than 60 million people died worldwide. Why? Because of twisted people who were whipping up the population into a frenzy and making ridiculous statements, killing innocent people simply because of their race or religion. The United States lost more than 400,000 lives fighting in that war, against the same ideas that Trump is pushing. The idea that certain religions are more dangerous than others and the idea that people should be judged based on the color of their skin rather than the content of their character.\r\n\r\nThey always say its so important to make your voice heard, to get out and vote. But Im not sure if its ever been more important than now.\r\nWere still healing from the damage inflicted by the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Iraq and the War on Terror. And it isnt just ISIS or Al-Qaeda. Its our own people in this country killing their fellow countrymen over differences of opinion, like whether or not you believe abortion is okay or what kind of political ideology you support. And then there are just the plainly insane people who finally snap and go on shooting rampages for no discernible reason at all. They just went mad.\r\n\r\nThe kind of leadership Trump is displaying is irresponsible and dangerous. His virulent ideas are seeping into the brains of his supporters. Supporters who think its okay to say things like light the mother@!$%#er on fire while a protester is being dragged out of one of his rallies. Maybe the protester was wrong to be where he was at the time, but no matter what he did, there was no reason to set him on fire. In fact, there is NEVER a reason to set anyone on fire. Unless its because they are dead and they wish to be cremated.\r\n\r\nTrumps supporters are angry, and anger is infectious. I can tell you as a non-supporter of Trump I am just as angry. We need the kind of leader that seeks to bring us together, not tear us apart. Why do we have to fight against helping each other, against common sense, against a united Nation? The American Dream is a nightmare and we are feeding it, making it worse every day. Trump is a bully, a loud mouth, ignorant, sexist, racist, disgusting example of how horrible humans can potentially be.\r\n\r\nHe is the crazy person at your dinner table who wont stop running his mouth. The only reason he is allowed to carry on with his ugly hateful rhetoric is because you have too much respect for Grandma to get into a fist fight in her home. Hes the guy you have to endure until he leaves, all the while hating every minute that you have to occupy the same space. Lucky for us, this isnt Grandmas house, so feel free to punch him in the mouth in the form of getting out and making your vote count.\r\n\r\nThey always say its so important to make your voice heard, to get out and vote. But Im not sure if its ever been more important than now. Differences of political ideals are one thing, I can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics, but racism isnt one of them, neither is hate, neither is the belittling of women or the judgment of others based on their appearance or their disability, or their sexual preference.\r\n\r\nBy supporting Trump do you think things will go back to the way they were? Back when gay people had to hide in fear, back when people of any other color than white had to worry about getting lynched, back when it was okay to openly hate? Do you think empowered women will suddenly quit their jobs and go back to the kitchen ? Because electing Trump wont make any of that come true. Were past that as a nation, or at least I thought we were.\r\n\r\nI can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics, but racism isnt one of them, neither is hate, neither is the belittling of women...\r\nIf youre not a racist, bigoted, misogynistic jerk, then voting for Trump simply because you dont like Democrats is wrong. If you are one of his supporters and youre just a racist and you dont care who knows it then vote for him, but know that the good people of America will not stand for it and he will never win a fair election. And please consider pursuing an education and work on your empathy toward your fellow human beings. Whatever led you to believe that racism is okay can be unlearned if you open your mind. Im sorry that you were raised to believe that you deserve better treatment than the rest of the people on the planet that have different views than yours, worship different gods than you and have skin that isnt white.\r\n\r\nTo all the people, of all the races and religions that Donald Trump stands against, to all the women that dont meet his standards of beauty, to all the good Muslims, and Christians, Mormons and Catholics and Jewish, Italians, Irish and Asians, to the African-Americans and Native Americans, to anyone who has ever been persecuted, belittled, made to feel inferior or bullied based on ignorance like the kind that Trump is spewing, please, I implore you to get out and vote against him. Dont let the progress of this great nation be halted. Weve come too far.\r\n\r\nIn this country we FIGHT and DIE for freedom, for Truth and Justice. We fight for whats right. And what Trump is doing and saying isnt right. Some have attributed the following statement to Abraham Lincoln*:\r\n\r\nI see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and cause me to tremble for safety of my country; corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption in High Places will follow, and the Money Power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the People, until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the Republic destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd he couldnt be more right. Trump IS the one percent, he IS working on your prejudices, and he WILL destroy the Republic if he is elected, make no doubt about it.\r\n\r\nIf you dont believe me, just look at the level of crazy coming out of his own mouth:\r\n\r\n[I am] calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countrys representatives can figure out what is going on  Donald Trump. Thats religious discrimination.\r\n\r\nAn extremely credible source has called my office and told me that Barack Obamas birth certificate is a fraud  Donald Trump. Thats an outright lie.\r\n\r\nArianna Huffington is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man - he made a good decision.  Donald Trump. This is sexism, and just plain rude.\r\n\r\nYou know, it really doesnt matter what the media write as long as youve got a young, and beautiful, piece of @!$%#. - Donald Trump. This is misogyny at its finest.\r\n\r\nI will build a great wall  and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me  and Ill build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. - Donald Trump. The words of an arrogant hate monger.\r\n\r\nWhen Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending the best. Theyre not sending you, theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us. Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists... And some, I assume, are good people.  Donald Trump. Racist.\r\n\r\nOur great African-American President hasnt exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore.  Donald Trump. Racist.\r\n\r\nIf I were running The View, Id fire Rosie ODonnell. I mean, Id look at her right in that fat, ugly face of hers, Id say Rosie, youre fired.  Donald Trump. The words of an @!$%#.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of me is that Im very rich. - Donald Trump. So Vain.\r\n\r\nIts freezing and snowing in New York - we need global warming! - Donald Trump. Ignorant.\r\n\r\nMy fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my body. - Donald Trump. Gross.\r\n\r\nI think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that Im more honest and my women are beautiful. - Donald Trump. Sexist. As if women are possessions rather than people. And also a lie. A lie about how honest he is.\r\n\r\nHow can you support this man?\r\n\r\n*I am aware of the fact that snopes.com claims the Lincoln Capitalism Prophecy quote is false. Its a quote that has been going around for more than a hundred years. The quote has also been attributed to a letter that Lincoln supposedly wrote to Col. William F. Elkins in 1864. Scholars have cited The Lincoln Encyclopedia: The Spoken and Written Words of A. Lincoln Arranged for Ready Reference by Archer H. Shaw. Snopes still claims the letter referred to in this encyclopedia is a fraud, forged by Emanuel Hertz in his book Abraham Lincoln: A New Portrait. So in the interest of full disclosure, these may or may not have been Lincolns words. Whether they were written by Hertz or Lincoln, they were still written and they still pertain to the point I was trying to make. Income inequality is a serious issue in this country, and Donald Trump is working on the prejudices of the people.",

    "text": "Why Is Clinton disliked?\r\n\r\nWhy the hate for Hillary?\r\n\r\nWhy do people hate Hillary Clinton so much?\r\n\r\nIs it because of partisanship?\r\n\r\nOr a hard-fought primary?\r\n\r\nMaybe, NBC once suggested, its because shes not a train wreck.\r\n\r\nFunny how the answers seem to be everything but the obvious.\r\n\r\nWe go on endlessly about how untrustworthy she is, while fact checkers rank her as the second-most honest prominent politician in the country. (And her opponent as by far the least.)\r\n\r\nWe say that she has trouble with transparency, while her opponent refuses to release his taxes and the current administration sets records for secrecy.\r\n\r\nWe decry her ties to corporations and the financial industry, while supporting a walking tax shelter or mourning the exit of a president whose re-election was funded by a record-shattering Wall Street haul.\r\n\r\nWe list so very many explanations, all of them complete bullshit.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the Hillary haters seem to resent her more than disagree with her. They demand to be humored and catered to. They hold her to wildly different standards than her male counterparts. They regard her with an unprecedented degree of suspicion. Above all, they really, really want to see her punished. And an aggressive male presenceeven if dangerously incompetentseems to comfort a great many of them.\r\n\r\nEveryone but them knows damn well why.\r\n\r\nBad news for the haters: History is decidedly unafraid of the woman card. It doesnt care how many people will stand on tables today and swear theyd feel the same if she were a man. It will see us for what we area sick society, driven by misogyny and pathetically struggling to come to terms with the fact that women do not exist solely to nurture.\r\n\r\nIf that answer isnt as nuanced as the average thinkpiece, thats because we, as a people, are not. No matter how many branches have formed, they all emerged from the same seed, planted way back when Bill Clinton first ran for governor. She wouldnt be so suspicious of the press, or so measured in her presentation, or so any one of a thousand other things, if she had been born a man.\r\n\r\nThe lengths we go to in order to rationalize this all will be seen, in retrospect, as extraordinary.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bush administration was discovered to have erased millions of emails illegally sent by 22 administration officials through private, RNC-owned accounts, in order to thwart an investigation into the politically motivated firing of eight US attorneys, just one talk show covered it that Sunday.\r\n\r\nWhen Mitt Romney wiped servers, sold government hard drives to his closest aides and spent $100,000 in taxpayer money to destroy his administrations emails, it was barely an issue.\r\n\r\nWhen Hillary Clinton asked Colin Powell how he managed to use a Blackberry while serving as Secretary of State, he replied by detailing his method of intentionally bypassing federal record-keeping laws:\r\n\r\nI didnt have a Blackberry. What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels.\r\n\r\n... There is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it [sic] government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law.\r\n\r\nYet the fact that Hillary Clinton emailed through a private server and didnt use it to cover anything up is somehow the defining issue of her campaign. My God, people cry, anyone else would be in jail!\r\n\r\nOr is the real scandal that her family runs but does not profit from a charitable foundation awarded an A grade by Charity Watch, a four out of four star rating by Charity Navigator and responsible for helping 435 million people in 180 countries get things like clean drinking water and HIV medication? Because the AP seems super concerned that she encountered people who donated to itspecifically Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunusin her official capacity as Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nIt should at this point be observed that her opponent is a shameless con artist who has built an empire bilking people with fake businesses, fake universities, fake charities and, now, a fake campaign. Last week, he told a lie every three minutes and fifteen seconds. Oh, and did we mention that he, like so many of his online supporters, is a goddamn Russian stooge? I tried to list all of the dumb, awful stuff that he does every day and I cannot come close to keeping up.\r\n\r\nVoters, it seems, are his easiest marks yet.\r\n\r\nAnd it isnt just Republicans. The double standards are even more transparent on the left.\r\n\r\nBack in the mid-90s, Clintons persistent unwillingness to hide the fact that she was a thinking human female really freaked the center-left establishment out. Michael Moore observed that, [Maureen Dowd] is fixated on trashing Hillary Rodham in the way liberals love to do, to prove theyre not really liberal. The bashing slowly morphed into a creepy, extraordinary sort of policing.\r\n\r\nSince then, Clinton racked up a Senate voting record more liberal than any nominee since Mondale. Her 2008 platform was slightly to Obamas left on domestic issues. Her 2016 platform was barely to the right of self-proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders.\r\n\r\nYet, we have all heard and seen countless liberal posers passionately decrying her far right voting record, untrustworthy promises or ever-changing policy positions. Jon Stewart recently called Clinton a bright woman without the courage of her convictions, because I dont know what they even are. Because if he doesnt know, she must not have any, right?\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is a very lengthy trail of public records all pointing in the same direction. If you cant figure out which, maybe the problem is you.\r\n\r\nYet, many on the left who gladly voted for John Kerry, two years after he voted to authorize the Iraq war, now say they couldnt possibly vote for Clinton, because she did, too.\r\n\r\nAnd view her with contempt for opposing same-sex marriage in 2008, while fawning over men like Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders, who held the same position at the same time.\r\n\r\nIts time to stop pretending that this is about substance. This is about an eagerness to believe that a woman who seeks power will say or do anything to get it. This is about a Lady MacBeth stereotype that, frankly, should never have existed in the first place. This is about the one thing no one wants to admit its about.\r\n\r\nConsider, for a moment, two people. One, as a young woman at the beginning of a promising legal career, went door to door searching for ways to guarantee an education to the countless disabled and disadvantaged children who had fallen through the cracks. The other, as a young millionaire, exacted revenge on his recently deceased brothers family by cutting off the medical insurance desperately needed by his nephews newborn son, who at eighteen months of age was suffering from violent seizures brought on by a rare neurological disorder.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of a society treats these two people as equal in any way? What kind of society even considers the latter over the former for its highest office?\r\n\r\nGenerations from now, people will shake their heads at this moment in time, when the first female major party presidential nomineecompetent, qualified and more thoroughly vetted than any non-incumbent candidate in historyendured the humiliation of being likened to such an obvious grifter, ignoramus and hate monger.\r\n\r\nWe deserve the shame that we will bear.",

    "text": "In the heat of a presidential campaign, youd think that a story about one partys nominee giving a large contribution to a state attorney general who promptly shut down an inquiry into that nominees scam university would be enormous news. But we continue to hear almost nothing about what happened between Donald Trump and Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.\r\n\r\nI raised this issue last week, but its worth an update as well as some contextualization. The story re-emerged last week when The Posts David A. Fahrenthold reported that Trump paid a penalty to the IRS after his foundation made an illegal contribution to Bondis PAC. While the Trump organization characterizes that as a bureaucratic oversight, the basic facts are that Bondis office had received multiple complaints from Floridians who said they were cheated by Trump University; while they were looking into it and considering whether to join a lawsuit over Trump University filed by the attorney general of New York State, Bondi called Trump and asked him for a $25,000 donation; shortly after getting the check, Bondis office dropped the inquiry.\r\n\r\nAt this point we should note that everything here may be completely innocent. Perhaps Bondi didnt realize her office was looking into Trump University. Perhaps the fact that Trumps foundation made the contribution (which, to repeat, is illegal) was just a mix-up. Perhaps when Trump reimbursed the foundation from his personal account, he didnt realize thats not how the law works (the foundation would have to get its money back from Bondis PAC; he could then make a personal donation if he wanted). Perhaps Bondis decision not to pursue the case against Trump was perfectly reasonable. \r\n\r\nBut heres the thing: We dont know the answers to those questions, because almost nobody seems to be pursuing them.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there was only one mention of this story on any of the five Sunday shows, when John Dickerson asked Chris Christie about it on Face the Nation (Christie took great umbrage: I cant believe, John, that anyone would insult Pam Bondi that way). And the comparison with stories about Hillary Clintons emails or the Clinton Foundation is extremely instructive. Whenever we get some new development in any of those Clinton stories, you see blanket coverage  every cable network, every network news program, every newspaper investigates it at length. And even when the new information serves to exonerate Clinton rather than implicate her in wrongdoing, the coverage still emphasizes that the whole thing just raises questions about her integrity.\r\n\r\nThe big difference is that there are an enormous number of reporters who get assigned to write stories about those issues regarding Clinton. The story of something like the Clinton Foundation gets stretched out over months and months with repeated tellings, always with the insistence that questions are being raised and the implication that shady things are going on, even if there isnt any evidence at a particular moment to support that idea.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Trump, on the other hand, weve seen a very different pattern. Heres what happens: A story about some kind of corrupt dealing emerges, usually from the dogged efforts of one or a few journalists; it gets discussed for a couple of days; and then it disappears. Someone might mention it now and again, but the news organizations dont assign a squad of reporters to look into every aspect of it, so no new facts are brought to light and no new stories get written.\r\n\r\nThe end result of this process is that because of all that repeated examination of Clintons affairs, people become convinced that she must be corrupt to the core. Its not that there isnt plenty of negative coverage of Trump, because of course there is, but its focused mostly on the crazy things he says on any given day.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is that youd have to work incredibly hard to find a politician who has the kind of history of corruption, double-dealing, and fraud that Donald Trump has. The number of stories which could potentially deserve hundreds and hundreds of articles is absolutely staggering. Heres a partial list:\r\n\r\nTrumps casino bankruptcies, which left investors holding the bag while he skedaddled with their money\r\nTrumps habit of refusing to pay contractors who had done work for him, many of whom are struggling small businesses\r\nTrump University, which includes not only the people who got scammed and the Florida investigation, but also a similar story from Texas where the investigation into Trump U was quashed.\r\nThe Trump Institute, another get-rich-quick scheme in which Trump allowed a couple of grifters to use his name to bilk people out of their money\r\nThe Trump Network, a multi-level marketing venture (a.k.a. pyramid scheme) that involved customers mailing in a urine sample which would be analyzed to produce for them a specially formulated package of multivitamins\r\nTrump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally, and kept them in squalid conditions while they earned almost nothing for the work they did\r\nTrumps employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, which involves a claim that he cant find Americans to do the work\r\nTrumps use of hundreds of undocumented workers from Poland in the 1980s, who were paid a pittance for their illegal work\r\nTrumps history of being charged with housing discrimination\r\nTrumps connections to mafia figures involved in New York construction\r\nThe time Trump paid the Federal Trade Commission $750,000 over charges that he violated anti-trust laws when trying to take over a rival casino company\r\nThe fact that Trump is now being advised by Roger Ailes, who was forced out as Fox News chief when dozens of women came forward to charge him with sexual harassment. According to the allegations, Ailess behavior was positively monstrous; as just one indicator, his abusive and predatory actions toward women were so well-known and so loathsome that in 1968 the morally upstanding folks in the Nixon administration refused to allow him to work there despite his key role in getting Nixon elected.\r\nAnd that last one is happening right now. To repeat, the point is not that these stories have never been covered, because they have. The point is that they get covered briefly, then everyone in the media moves on. If any of these kinds of stories involved Clinton, news organizations would rush to assign multiple reporters to them, those reporters would start asking questions, and wed learn more about all of them.\r\n\r\nThats important, because we may have reached a point where the frames around the candidates are locked in: Trump is supposedly the crazy/bigoted one, and Clinton is supposedly the corrupt one. Once we decide that those are the appropriate lenses through which the two candidates are to be viewed, it shapes the decisions the media make every day about which stories are important to pursue.\r\n\r\nAnd it means that to a great extent, for all the controversy he has caused and all the unflattering stories in the press about him, Trump is still being let off the hook.",

    "text": "In any normal election year, wed compare the two presidential candidates side by side on the issues. But this is not a normal election year. A comparison like that would be an empty exercise in a race where one candidate  our choice, Hillary Clinton  has a record of service and a raft of pragmatic ideas, and the other, Donald Trump, discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway. (We will explain in a subsequent editorial why we believe Mr. Trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history.)\r\n\r\nBut this endorsement would also be an empty exercise if it merely affirmed the choice of Clinton supporters. Were aiming instead to persuade those of you who are hesitating to vote for Mrs. Clinton  because you are reluctant to vote for a Democrat, or for another Clinton, or for a candidate who might appear, on the surface, not to offer change from an establishment that seems indifferent and a political system that seems broken.\r\n\r\nRunning down the other guy wont suffice to make that argument. The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isnt Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nThe best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs. Clintons capacity to rise to them.\r\n\r\nCan Hillary Clinton Keep You Safe?

    "text": "DONALD J. TRUMP, until now a Republican problem, this week became a challenge the nation must confront and overcome. The real estate tycoon is uniquely unqualified to serve as president, in experience and temperament. He is mounting a campaign of snarl and sneer, not substance. To the extent he has views, they are wrong in their diagnosis of Americas problems and dangerous in their proposed solutions. Mr. Trumps politics of denigration and division could strain the bonds that have held a diverse nation together. His contempt for constitutional norms might reveal the nations two-century-old experiment in checks and balances to be more fragile than we knew.\r\n\r\nAny one of these characteristics would be disqualifying; together, they make Mr. Trump a peril. We recognize that this is not the usual moment to make such a statement. In an ordinary election year, we would acknowledge the Republican nominee, move on to the Democratic convention and spend the following months, like other voters, evaluating the candidates performance in debates, on the stump and in position papers. This year we will follow the campaign as always, offering honest views on all the candidates. But we cannot salute the Republican nominee or pretend that we might endorse him this fall. A Trump presidency would be dangerous for the nation and the world.\r\n\r\nWhy are we so sure? Start with experience. It has been 64 years since a major party nominated anyone for president who did not have electoral experience. That experiment turned out pretty well  but Mr. Trump, to put it mildly, is no Dwight David Eisenhower. Leading the Allied campaign to liberate Europe from the Nazis required strategic and political skills of the first order, and Eisenhower  though he liked to emphasize his common touch as he faced the intellectual Democrat Adlai Stevenson  was shrewd, diligent, humble and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, there is nothing on Mr. Trumps rsum to suggest he could function successfully in Washington. He was staked in the family business by a well-to-do father and has pursued a career marked by some real estate successes, some failures and repeated episodes of saving his own hide while harming people who trusted him. Given his continuing refusal to release his tax returns, breaking with a long bipartisan tradition, it is only reasonable to assume there are aspects of his record even more discreditable than what we know.\r\n\r\nThe lack of experience might be overcome if Mr. Trump saw it as a handicap worth overcoming. But he displays no curiosity, reads no books and appears to believe he needs no advice. In fact, what makes Mr. Trump so unusual is his combination of extreme neediness and unbridled arrogance. He is desperate for affirmation but contemptuous of other views. He also is contemptuous of fact. Throughout the campaign, he has unspooled one lie after another  that Muslims in New Jersey celebrated after 9/11, that his tax-cut plan would not worsen the deficit, that he opposed the Iraq War before it started  and when confronted with contrary evidence, he simply repeats the lie. It is impossible to know whether he convinces himself of his own untruths or knows that he is wrong and does not care. It is also difficult to know which trait would be more frightening in a commander in chief.\r\n\r\nGiven his ignorance, it is perhaps not surprising that Mr. Trump offers no coherence when it comes to policy. In years past, he supported immigration reform, gun control and legal abortion; as candidate, he became a hard-line opponent of all three. Even in the course of the campaign, he has flip-flopped on issues such as whether Muslims should be banned from entering the United States and whether women who have abortions should be punished . Worse than the flip-flops is the absence of any substance in his agenda. Existing trade deals are stupid, but Mr. Trump does not say how they could be improved. The Islamic State must be destroyed, but the candidate offers no strategy for doing so. Eleven million undocumented immigrants must be deported, but Mr. Trump does not tell us how he would accomplish this legally or practically.\r\n\r\nWhat the candidate does offer is a series of prejudices and gut feelings, most of them erroneous. Allies are taking advantage of the United States. Immigrants are committing crimes and stealing jobs. Muslims hate America. In fact, Japan and South Korea are major contributors to an alliance that has preserved a peace of enormous benefit to Americans. Immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans and take jobs that no one else will. Muslims are the primary victims of Islamist terrorism, and Muslim Americans, including thousands who have served in the military, are as patriotic as anyone else.\r\n\r\n[Fareed Zakaria: America would be Trumps banana republic]\r\n\r\nThe Trump litany of victimization has resonated with many Americans whose economic prospects have stagnated. They deserve a serious champion, and the challenges of inequality and slow wage growth deserve a serious response. But Mr. Trump has nothing positive to offer, only scapegoats and dark conspiracy theories. He launched his campaign by accusing Mexico of sending rapists across the border, and similar hatefulness has surfaced numerous times in the year since.\r\n\r\nIn a dangerous world, Mr. Trump speaks blithely of abandoning NATO, encouraging more nations to obtain nuclear weapons and cozying up to dictators who in fact wish the United States nothing but harm. For eight years, Republicans have criticized President Obama for apologizing for America and for weakening alliances. Now they put forward a candidate who mimics the vilest propaganda of authoritarian adversaries about how terrible the United States is and how unfit it is to lecture others. He has made clear that he would drop allies without a second thought. The consequences to global security could be disastrous.\r\n\r\nMost alarming is Mr. Trumps contempt for the Constitution and the unwritten democratic norms upon which our system depends. He doesnt know what is in the nations founding document. When asked by a member of Congress about Article I, which enumerates congressional powers, the candidate responded, I am going to abide by the Constitution whether its number 1, number 2, number 12, number 9. The charter has seven articles.\r\n\r\nWorse, he doesnt seem to care about its limitations on executive power. He has threatened that those who criticize him will suffer when he is president. He has vowed to torture suspected terrorists and bomb their innocent relatives, no matter the illegality of either act. He has vowed to constrict the independent press. He went after a judge whose rulings angered him, exacerbating his contempt for the independence of the judiciary by insisting that the judge should be disqualified because of his Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump has encouraged and celebrated violence at his rallies. The U.S. democratic system is strong and has proved resilient when it has been tested before. We have faith in it. But to elect Mr. Trump would be to knowingly subject it to threat.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump campaigns by insult and denigration, insinuation and wild accusation: Ted Cruzs father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; Hillary Clinton may be guilty of murder; Mr. Obama is a traitor who wants Muslims to attack. The Republican Party has moved the lunatic fringe onto center stage, with discourse that renders impossible the kind of substantive debate upon which any civil democracy depends.\r\n\r\nMost responsible Republican leaders know all this to be true; that is why Mr. Trump had to rely so heavily on testimonials by relatives and employees during this weeks Republican convention. With one exception (Bob Dole), the living Republican presidents and presidential nominees of the past three decades all stayed away. But most current officeholders, even those who declared Mr. Trump to be an unthinkable choice only months ago, have lost the courage to speak out.\r\n\r\nThe partys failure of judgment leaves the nations future where it belongs, in the hands of voters. Many Americans do not like either candidate this year . We have criticized the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in the past and will do so again when warranted. But we do not believe that she (or the Libertarian and Green party candidates, for that matter) represents a threat to the Constitution. Mr. Trump is a unique and present danger.",

    "text": "As a retired military officer, I watched last nights Republican debate from Detroit (transcript here) with a special focus on which candidate is qualified to lead the military as commander-in-chief.  I knew, of course, that Donald Trump had promised in the past to use torture against Americas enemies (last night, he called them animals), that he would pursue and kill not only terrorists but their families (apparently because the families always know, according to Trump, what their father/brother/sister is up to, as if there are no secrets in families).  Trump, in short, is an Old Testament eye for an eye man: if they behead us, well torture and kill them, end of story.\r\n\r\nBut Trump was put on the spot when he was asked what he would do if the U.S. military failed to carry out his unlawful orders. Instead of saying he wouldnt issue unlawful orders, that he would support and defend the U.S. Constitution, which as president would be his sworn duty to uphold, Trump boasted that the military would follow his orders no matter what.\r\n\r\nAmerica: those are the words of a dictator.\r\n\r\nHeres what was said:\r\n\r\nBAIER: Mr. Trump, just yesterday, almost 100 foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you, saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable. General Michael Hayden, former CIA director, NSA director, and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorists families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because theyve been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders.\r\n\r\nSo what would you do, as commander-in-chief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders?\r\n\r\nTRUMP: They wont refuse. Theyre not going to refuse me. Believe me.\r\n\r\nBAIER: But theyre illegal.\r\n\r\nTRUMP: Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East. Theyre chopping off heads. Theyre chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way. Theyre drowning people in steel cages. And he  now were talking about waterboarding.\r\n\r\nThis really started with Ted, a question was asked of Ted last  two debates ago about waterboarding. And Ted was, you know, having a hard time with that question, to be totally honest with you. They then came to me, what do you think of waterboarding? I said its fine. And if we want to go stronger, Id go stronger, too, because, frankly...\r\n\r\n(APPLAUSE)\r\n\r\n... thats the way I feel. Can you imagine  can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that were having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. Thats my opinion.\r\n\r\nBAIER: But targeting terrorists families?\r\n\r\n(APPLAUSE)\r\n\r\nTRUMP: And  and  and  Im a leader. Im a leader. Ive always been a leader. Ive never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, theyre going to do it. Thats what leadership is all about.\r\n\r\nOur military does not follow blindly orders issued by The Leader. Our military swears an oath to the Constitution.  We swear to uphold the law of the land.  We dont swear allegiance to a single man (or woman) as president.\r\n\r\nTrumps performance last night reminded me of Richard Nixons infamous answer to David Frost about Watergate: When the president does it, that means its not illegal. No, no, a thousand times no.  The president has to obey the law of the land, just as everyone else has to.  No person is above the law, an American ideal that Trump seems neither to understand nor to embrace.\r\n\r\nAnd that disqualifies him to be president and commander-in-chief.",

But the Kasich campaign released a Web ad Tuesday directly attacked Trump with a darker tone than any other candidate has used so far to go after the business mogul.\r\n\r\nThe spot features retired Air Force Col. Tom Moe speaking at an event in Ohio, the same day Trump held a rally in Columbus. Moe, who the Kasich campaign identifies as a former Vietnam POW, paraphrases a quote from Protestant pastor Martin Niemller, taken from his lectures after World War II.\r\n\r\n\"You might not care if Donald Trump says Muslims should register with their government, because you're not one,\" says Moe, to an ominous soundtrack. \"And you might not care if Donald Trump says he's going to round up all the Hispanic immigrants, because you're not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump says it's okay to rough up black protesters, because you're not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump wants to suppress journalists, because you're not one. But think about this: If he keeps going, and he actually becomes president, he might just get around to you. And you better hope there's someone left to help you.\"\r\n\r\nThe new spot came just a day after both the campaign and the super PAC supporting Kasich released a pair of spots attacking the GOP front-runner -- and hours after the candidates' latest Twitter spat:\r\n\r\nLater Monday, Kasich wound up a day-long anti-Trump tweetstorm with a challenge:",

    "text": "Median income would soar by more than $22,000. Nearly 26 million jobs would be created. The unemployment rate would fall to 3.8%.\r\nThose are just a few of the things that would happen if Bernie Sanders became president and his ambitious economic program were put into effect, according to an analysis given exclusively to CNNMoney. The first comprehensive look at the impact of all of Sanders' spending and tax proposals on the economy was done by Gerald Friedman, a University of Massachusetts Amherst economics professor.\r\nThis more sweeping analysis was not commissioned by the candidate, though Sanders' policy director called it \"outstanding work.\" Friedman has worked with Sanders in the past, but has never received any compensation. The Vermont senator asked Friedman to estimate the cost of Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan -- which came out to $13.8 trillion over 10 years -- and included the analysis when he unveiled his proposal last month.\r\nFriedman, who believes in democratic socialism like the candidate, found that if Sanders became president -- and was able to push his plan through Congress -- median household income would be $82,200 by 2026, far higher than the $59,300 projected by the Congressional Budget Office.\r\nIn addition, poverty would plummet to a record low 6%, as opposed to the CBO's forecast of 13.9%. The U.S. economy would grow by 5.3% per year, instead of 2.1%, and the nation's $1.3 trillion deficit would turn into a large surplus by Sanders' second term.\r\nOther economists, however, feel that Friedman's analysis is overly optimistic, saying it would be difficult to achieve that level of economic prosperity. Last week, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said Sanders' plan to pay for health care would fall short by at least $3 trillion.\r\nRelated: 5 unanswered questions about Bernie Sanders' health care plan\r\nSanders' plan to pour $14.5 trillion into the economy -- including spending on infrastructure and youth employment, increasing Social Security benefits, making college free and expanding health care and family leave -- would juice GDP and productivity. (Friedman reduces the cost of Medicare-for-all to $10.7 trillion because he estimates the government would save $3.1 trillion by eliminating tax breaks for health insurance premiums.)\r\nAlso, Sanders would raise the minimum wage, as well as shift income from the rich to the middle and working class through tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations.\r\n\"Like the New Deal of the 1930s, Senator Sanders' program is designed to do more than merely increase economic activity,\" Friedman writes. It will \"promote a more just prosperity, broadly-based with a narrowing of economy inequality.\"\r\nMany presidential hopefuls say their economic programs would boost growth. Donald Trump and Jeb Bush justify their big tax cuts by saying GDP would grow at a 4% rate. But their plans have been panned by experts as overly optimistic.\r\nFriedman, however, argues that Sanders' plan would be more stimulative because it is pouring money into the economy, as opposed to cutting taxes. Several of Sanders' proposals -- such as spending $1 trillion on infrastructure -- will happen in the first few years of his administration.\r\nThe thinking goes: This enhanced government spending would increase demand on businesses, who would then hire more workers to meet their needs. The increase in employment will prompt people to buy more, leading other businesses to hire.\r\n\"If there is more spending, people will have more to do,\" Friedman said, noting that the share of the population with jobs could be restored to its 1999 level of more than 64%, up from its current 59.6% rate.\r\nRelated: Can Bernie Sanders deliver free college for all? Not so easily\r\nSanders' policy director, Warren Gunnels, also defended the estimates, noting the candidate is thinking big.\r\n\"We haven't had such an ambitious agenda to rebuild the middle class since Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Johnson,\" he said.\r\n Sword swallowers and acrobats turn out for Bernie in Brooklyn\r\nSword swallowers and acrobats turn out for Bernie in Brooklyn\r\nStill, some experts question whether the effects would be that large.\r\nStimulating demand can boost a weak economy during a recession, but \"it's harder to accept as a long-run growth strategy,\" said William Gale, the former director of Brookings' Economic Studies Program.\r\nAlso, it would be very difficult to achieve and maintain an economic growth rate of 5.3% per year after inflation. That target hasn't been hit consistently since the 1960s, when technology was providing big advancements, the workforce was younger and there was increased demand for American products worldwide as other countries fully recovered from World War II.\r\n\"The 5.3% number is a fantasy,\" said Jim Kessler, senior vice president at Third Way, a centrist think tank.",

    "text": "Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offenders infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the Lolita Express -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com.\r\n\r\nClintons presence aboard Jeffrey Epsteins Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including Tatiana. The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.\r\n\r\nBill Clinton  associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile, said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called \"TrafficKing.\" Why would a former president associate with a man like that?\r\n\r\nVirginia Roberts, 32, who claims she was pimped out by Epstein at age 15, has previously claimed she saw Clinton at Epsteins getaway in 2002, but logs do not show Clinton aboard any flights to St. Thomas, the nearest airport capable of accommodating Epstein's plane. They do show Clinton flying aboard Epsteins plane to such destinations as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, China, Brunei, London, New York, the Azores, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Africa.\r\n\r\nAmong those regularly traveling with Clinton were Epsteins associates, New York socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and Epsteins assistant, Sarah Kellen, both of whom were investigated by the FBI and Palm Beach Police for recruiting girls for Epstein and his friends.\r\n\r\nIn response to a separate FOIA request from FoxNews.com, the U.S. Secret Service said it has no records showing agents were ever on the island with Clinton.\r\n\r\nA Clinton spokesperson did not return emails requesting comment about the former presidents relationship and travels with Epstein. The Clinton Library said it had no relevant information and does not keep track of Clintons travel records.\r\n\r\nMartin Weinberg, Epsteins current attorney, did not respond to multiple inquiries. Epstein said in a court filing said that he and his associates have been the subject of the most outlandish and offensive attacks, allegations, and plain inventions.\r\n\r\nPolice in Palm Beach, Fla., launched a year-long investigation in 2005 into Epstein after parents of a 14-year-old girl said their daughter was sexually abused by him. Police interviewed dozens of witnesses, confiscated his trash, performed surveillance and searched his Palm Beach mansion, ultimately identifying 20 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 who they said were sexually abused by Epstein.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, at the request of Palm Beach Police, the FBI launched a federal probe into allegations that Epstein and his personal assistants had used facilities of interstate commerce to induce girls between the ages of 14 and 17 to engage in illegal sexual activities.\r\n\r\nAccording to court documents, police investigators found a clear indication that Epsteins staff was frequently working to schedule multiple young girls between the ages of 12 and 16 years old literally every day, often two or three times per day.\r\n\r\nOne victim, in sworn deposition testimony, said Epstein began sexually assaulting her when she was 13 years old and molested her on more than 50 occasions over the next three years. The girls testified they were lured to Epsteins home after being promised hundreds of dollars to be his model or masseuse, but when they arrived, he ordered them to take off their clothes and massage his naked body while he masturbated and used sex toys on them.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prepared charging documents that accused Epstein of child sex abuse, witness tampering and money laundering, but Epstein took a plea deal before an indictment could be handed up.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 24, 2007, in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency, Epstein agreed to a 30-month sentence, including 18 months of jail time and 12 months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuse.\r\n\r\nIn exchange, the U.S. Attorneys Office promised not to pursue any federal charges against Epstein or his co-conspirators.\r\n\r\nFlorida attorney Brad Edwards, who represented some of Epsteins alleged victims, is suing the federal government over the secret non-prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned. Edwards claimed in court records that the government and Epstein concealed the deal from the victims to prevent them from voicing any objection, and to avoid the firestorm of controversy that would have arisen if it had become known that the Government was immunizing a politically-connected billionaire and all of his co-conspirators from prosecution of hundreds of federal sex crimes against minor girls.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida did not respond to a request for comment about the deal.\r\n\r\nOther politicians, celebrities and businessmen, including presidential candidate Donald Trump, have been accused of fraternizing with Epstein. Trump lawyer Alan Garten told FoxNews.com in a statement Trump and Epstein are not pals.\r\n\r\nThere was no relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump, he said. They were not friends and they did not socialize together.",

    "text": "Donald Trump is going to be elected president.\r\n\r\nThe American people voted for him a long time ago.\r\n\r\nThey voted for him when The History Channel went from showing documentaries about the Second World War to Pawn Stars and Swamp People.\r\n\r\nThey voted for him when The Discovery Channel went from showing Lost Treasures of the Yangtze Valley to Naked and Afraid.\r\n\r\nThey voted for him when The Learning Channel moved from something you could learn from to My 600-lb Life.\r\n\r\nThey voted for him when CBS went from airing Harvest of Shame to airing Big Brother.\r\n\r\nThese networks didnt make these programming changes by accident. They were responding to what the American people actually wanted. And what they wanted was Naked and Afraid and Duck Dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe polls may show that Donald Trump is losing to Hillary Clinton, but dont you believe those polls. When the AC Nielsen Company selects a new Nielsen family, they disregard the new familys results for the first three months. The reason: when they feel they are being monitored, people lie about what they are watching. In the first three months, knowing they are being watched, they will tune into PBS. But over time they get tired of pretending. Then it is back to the Kardashians.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for people who are being asked by pollsters for whom they are voting. They will not say Donald Trump. It is too embarrassing. But the truth is, they like Trump. He is just like their favorite shows on TV.\r\n\r\nMindless entertainment.\r\n\r\nTrumps replacement of Paul Manafort with Breitbarts Steve Bannon shows that Trump understands how Americans actually think. They think TV. They think ratings. They think entertainment.\r\n\r\nWe are a TV-based culture. We have been for some time now. The average American spends 5 hours a day, every day, watching TV. After sleep, it is our number one activity.\r\n\r\nMore shockingly, we spend 8.5 hours a day staring at screens  phones, tablets, computers. And more and more of the content on those devices is also video and TV.\r\n\r\nIf you spend 5-8 hours a day, every day, for years and years doing the same thing it has an impact on you. For the past 40 years, we have devoted 5-8 hours a day staring at a screen  every day. And we havent been watching Judy Woodruff. We have been watching reality TV shows. That is what we love. That is what we resonate to. The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\r\n\r\nThe French may love food. The Italians may love opera. What we love is TV. We are TV culture. It defines who we are.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s, early television was allowed, with many restrictions, to be an observational guest at political conventions. They were quiet flies on the wall, carefully and quietly commentating on what they saw way down below. They did not get involved in the process. Today, they ARE the process. Today, political conventions are nothing but carefully directed TV shows. Likewise debates. They exist only to entertain a TV audience. TV and entertainment now dictate everything political. It is a never-ending show. The biggest reality show on air.\r\n\r\nAnd Donald Trump is great TV.\r\n\r\nHe knows how to entertain.\r\n\r\nHe understands ratings.\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton is crap TV.\r\n\r\nShe may be smarter, better prepared, a better politician. It wont matter. She is terrible entertainment.\r\n\r\nThats just how it is. Depressing, but true.\r\n\r\nHe is Kim Kardashian. She is Judy Woodruff.\r\n\r\nWho gets better ratings?\r\n\r\nWho would you rather watch for the next four years?\r\n\r\nHonestly...\r\n\r\nIn 1825, the great French gastronom Brillat de Savarind said, Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are. Today, in America, we can safely say, Tell me what you watch, and I will tell you what you are.\r\n\r\nAnd what do we watch?\r\n\r\nIt isnt PBS NewsHour.",

Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.\r\n\r\nNow here stands Mr. Trump, feisty from his runaway Republican primary victories and ready for the first presidential debate, scheduled for Monday night, with Hillary Clinton. It is time for others who are still undecided, and perhaps hoping for some dramatic change in our politics and governance, to take a hard look and see Mr. Trump for who he is. They have an obligation to scrutinize his supposed virtues as a refreshing counterpolitician. Otherwise, they could face the consequences of handing the White House to a man far more consumed with himself than with the nations well-being.\r\n\r\nHeres how Mr. Trump is selling himself and why he cant be believed.\r\n\r\nDon Levi September 27, 2016\r\nJust went through the history of the endorsements over the last 45-years from NYT.

His name has been chiseled off his failed casinos in Atlantic City.\r\n\r\nMr. Trumps brazen refusal to disclose his tax returns  as Mrs. Clinton and other nominees for decades have done  should sharpen voter wariness of his business and charitable operations. Disclosure would undoubtedly raise numerous red flags; the public record already indicates that in at least some years he made full use of available loopholes and paid no taxes.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump has been opaque about his questionable global investments in Russia and elsewhere, which could present conflicts of interest as president, particularly if his business interests are left in the hands of his children, as he intends. Investigations have found self-dealing. He notably tapped $258,000 in donors money from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits involving his for-profit businesses, according to The Washington Post.\r\n\r\nA straight talker who tells it like it is?\r\n\r\nMr. Trump, who has no experience in national security, declares that he has a plan to soundly defeat the Islamic State militants in Syria, but wont reveal it, bobbing and weaving about whether he would commit ground troops. Voters cannot judge whether he has any idea what hes talking about without an outline of his plan, yet Mr. Trump ludicrously insists he must not tip off the enemy.\r\n\r\nAnother of his cornerstone proposals  his campaign pledge of a total and complete shutdown of Muslim newcomers plus the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants across a border wall paid for by Mexico  has been subjected to endless qualifications as he zigs and zags in pursuit of middle-ground voters.\r\n\r\nWhatever his gyrations, Mr. Trump always does make clear where his heart lies  with the anti-immigrant, nativist and racist signals that he scurrilously employed to build his base.",

    "text": "Park City, Utah (CNN)Mitt Romney suggested Friday that Donald Trump's election could legitimize racism and misogyny, ushering in a change in the moral fabric of American society.\r\n\r\nThe 2012 Republican nominee, who has openly opposed Trump's candidacy, went further than he has before in outlining to CNN's Wolf Blitzer how the country's character would suffer in a Trump White House. Trump's rhetoric has caused even some other Republicans to label him a racist, and Romney said he would not be able to paper over his incendiary remarks.\r\n\"I don't want to see trickle-down racism,\" Romney said in an interview here in a suite overlooking the Wasatch Mountains, where he is hosting his yearly ideas conference. \"I don't want to see a president of the United States saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following. Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny, all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America.\"\r\nRomney retreat puts spotlight on Trump's fundraising problem in critical stretch\r\nTrump, speaking at a rally in Richmond, Virginia, Friday night, didn't address Romney's criticism directly but did say, \"I am the least racist person, the least racist person that you've ever seen,\" a line he frequently says at campaign events.\r\nBy Saturday morning, Trump was directly responding to Romney, tweeting, \"Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is.\"\r\n \r\nMitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is\r\n\r\nHe then added, \"Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!\"\r\n \r\nHe kept up his attacks while speaking at a campaign rally on Saturday in Tampa, Florida, telling the crowd, \"I don't think he knows what a misogynist is. Don't forget this guy let us down.\" He would later double down on the criticism at a campaign event in Pittsburgh.\r\nRomney considering Johnson\r\nRomney, who actively sought to recruit an independent, third-party challenger to Trump, also conceded that a credible candidate will not emerge. But he did show a new openness to one non-Trump candidate, libertarian Gary Johnson, whom he did not rule out voting for.\r\nJohnson's running mate is another former Massachusetts governor, Bill Weld, who once fundraised for Romney. If the ticket was flipped and Weld was the standard-bearer, Romney said he would have no qualms about voting for the libertarian ticket this fall.\r\nHillary Clinton huddles with top fundraisers\r\n\"If Bill Weld were at the top of the ticket, it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president,\" Romney said. \"So I'll get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he's someone who I could end up voting for. That's something which I'll evaluate over the coming weeks and months.\"\r\nRomney's comments on \"The Situation Room\" are some of the highest-profile support bestowed upon the libertarian ticket, which is almost certain to be less funded compared to the GOP and Democratic lines. He did however express an uneasiness with Johnson, given his position on marijuana legalization.\r\n\"Marijuana makes people stupid,\" Romney quipped.\r\nJohnson said Saturday that others should join Romney in giving the Libertarian nominees a closer look.\r\n\"I think Mitt Romney hit it on the head. He said, 'Hey, I'm going to check out Gary Johnson and see what he's got to say,'\" he told CNN's Victor Blackwell on \"CNN Newsroom.\" \"I think that kind of scrutiny holds up under the light of day.\"\r\n\t\r\nThe 2016 race, Obama's legacy, congressional gridlock  get the most important political news delivered to your inbox. By subscribing, you agree to our privacy policy.\r\n\r\nRomney once again ruled out running himself, but he was also candid about independent efforts to recruit a challenger. Several sought-after Republicans, including Ben Sasse and author David French, have taken passes.\r\nOrrin Hatch explains friendship with Muhammad Ali\r\n\"I think you're not going to find a credible candidate actually running as a third-party contender,\" Romney said. \"The only way to win the White House, in my view, is to become a nominee of either the Republican or the Democrat Party, and simply running to be a spoiler would not give the American people I think the chance to express their own views about Mr. Trump or about Secretary Clinton.\"\r\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, appearing later on \"The Situation Room,\" dismissed Romney's criticism.\r\n\"This again is just sour grapes from the establishment who have had the power stripped out of theirs hands by a candidate that they do not like because he has managed to do something they have been unable to do for decades,\" Pierson said.\r\nAnd Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted later Friday, \"Respect Mitt and differences but couldn't disagree more. SCOTUS too important to lose for generations. Let's stop this and unify.\"\r\n \r\nRespect Mitt and differences but couldn't disagree more. SCOTUS too important to lose for generations. Let's stop this and unify.\r\n\r\nIn Richmond, Trump alluded to his critics, though he didn't mention Romney by name.\r\nClinton donor received top spot on State Department intel board\r\n\"These poor people going, 'Never Trump, never Trump' -- they've been doing it for months. They did it with Indiana, they did it with New York -- 'We're going to win New York' -- and I won in a massive landslide.\"\r\n'My choice is different'\r\nRomney again speculated about what might be in Trump's tax returns, which he has repeatedly declined to release, claiming that he's under audit. Asked what might be in there, Romney referred to a months-ago comment by Trump that he could not lose support even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\r\n\"He's calculated that he could get support even if he shot someone, but if he released his taxes, he'd lose support,\" Romney said. \"So there's something in those taxes that's even worse than shooting someone on Fifth Avenue.\"\r\nYet Romney declined to criticize other Republicans who have harbored similar feelings about Trump but endorsed him. Romney's mentee and vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, has uneasily backed Trump, but Romney declined multiple chances to pass judgment on the speaker's decision.\r\n\"Are you disappointed Paul Ryan has endorsed him?\" Blitzer asked.\r\n\"I wish everybody in the Republican Party had rejected Mr. Trump and chosen someone else,\" Romney said. \"But my choice is different than that of the other people, and I'm certainly not going to argue with them about their choice.\"\r\nSanders to meet with top supporters to discuss campaign's future\r\nRomney also shared some disappointment in the Republican candidates who wooed him fervently for support, saying they largely shied away from a fight with Trump in the primary. For much of the campaign, Republican candidates squabbled to position themselves as the chief Trump alternative.\r\n\"I don't think he got the scrutiny applied to him that is typically applied to a front-runner by the people running against him,\" he said, lamenting that they were \"firing at each other.\" \"Jeb Bush had a super PAC of over $100 million. And they focused their fire on Marco Rubio and others, as opposed to focusing it on the front-runner.\"\r\nBut if Romney had ran?\r\n\"Had I been in the race,\" he said, \"I can assure you, I would have taken him on.\"",

    "text": "It seems were entering another of those stupid seasons humans impose on themselves at fairly regular intervals.\r\n\r\nMy background is archaeology, so also history and anthropology. It leads me to look at big historical patterns. My theory is that most peoples perspective of history is limited to the experience communicated by their parents and grandparents, so 50-100 years. To go beyond that you have to read, study and learn to untangle the propaganda that is inevitable in all telling of history. In a nutshell, at university I would fail a paper if I didnt compare at least two, if not three opposing views on a topic. Taking one telling of events as gospel doesnt wash in the comparative analytical method of research that forms the core of British academia. (I cant speak for other systems, but theyre definitely not all alike in this way.)\r\n\r\nSo zooming out, we humans have a habit of going into phases of mass destruction, generally self-imposed to some extent or another. This handy list shows all the wars over time. Wars are actually the norm for humans, but every now and then something big comes along. I am interested in the Black Death, which devastated Europe. The opening of Boccaccios Decameron describes Florence in the grips of the Plague. It is as beyond imagination as the Somme, Hiroshima or the Holocaust. I mean, you quite literally cant put yourself there and imagine what it was like. For those in the midst of the Plague, it must have felt like the end of the world.\r\n\r\n[Trump is] a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger, creating a cult around himself.\r\nBut a defining feature of humans is their resilience. To us now, it seems obvious that we survived the Plague, but to people at the time it must have seemed incredible that their society continued afterwards. Indeed, many takes on the effects of the Black Death are that it had a positive impact in the long term. Well summed up here:\r\n\r\nBy targeting frail people of all ages, and killing them by the hundreds of thousands within an extremely short period of time, the Black Death might have represented a strong force of natural selection and removed the weakest individuals on a very broad scale within Europe, ...In addition, the Black Death significantly changed the social structure of some European regions. Tragic depopulation created the shortage of working people. This shortage caused wages to rise. Products prices fell too. Consequently, standards of living increased. For instance, people started to consume more food of higher quality.\r\n\r\nBut for the people living through it, as with the World Wars, Soviet Famines, Holocaust, it must have felt inconceivable that humans could rise up from it. The collapse of the Roman Empire, Black Death, Spanish Inquisition, Thirty Years War, War of the Roses, English Civil War... its a long list. Events of massive destruction from which humanity recovered and move on, often in better shape.\r\n\r\nAt a local level in time, people think things are fine  then things rapidly spiral out of control until they become unstoppable, and we wreak massive destruction on ourselves. For the people living in the midst of this, it is hard to see happening and hard to understand. To historians later, it all makes sense and we see clearly how one thing led to another. During the Centenary of the Battle of the Somme I was struck that it was a direct outcome of the assassination of an Austrian Arch Duke in Bosnia. I very much doubt anyone at the time thought the killing of a minor European royal would lead to the death of 17 million people.\r\n\r\nMy point is that this is a cycle. It happens again and again, but as most people only have a 50-100 year historical perspective they dont see that its happening again. As the events that led to the First World War unfolded, there were a few brilliant minds who started to warn that something big was wrong, that the web of treaties across Europe could lead to a war, but they were dismissed as hysterical, mad, or fools, as is always the way, and as people who worry about Putin, Brexit and Trump are dismissed now.\r\n\r\nA little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if youd listened and thought a bit.\r\nThen after the War to end all Wars, we went and had another one. Again, for a historian it was quite predictable. Lead people to feel they have lost control of their country and destiny, people look for scapegoats, a charismatic leader captures the popular mood, and singles out that scapegoat. He talks in rhetoric that has no detail, and drums up anger and hatred. Soon the masses start to move as one, without any logic driving their actions, and the whole becomes unstoppable.\r\n\r\nThat was Hitler, but it was also Mussolini, Stalin, Putin, Mugabe and so many more. Mugabe is a very good case in point. He whipped up national anger and hatred towards the land owning white minority (who happened to know how to run farms), and seized their land to redistribute to the people, in a great populist move which in the end unravelled the economy and farming industry and left the people in possession of land, but starving. See also the famines created by the Soviet Union, and the one caused by the Chinese Communists last century in which 20-40 million people died. It seems inconceivable that people could create a situation in which tens of millions of people die without reason, but we do it again and again.\r\n\r\nBut at the time people dont realize theyre embarking on a route that will lead to a destruction period. They think theyre right, theyre cheered on by jeering angry mobs, their critics are mocked. This cycle, the one we saw for example from the Treaty of Versaille, to the rise of Hitler, to the Second World War, appears to be happening again. But as with before, most people cannot see it because:\r\n\r\n1. They are only looking at the present, not the past or future\r\n\r\n2. They are only looking immediately around them, not at how events connect globally\r\n\r\n3. Most people dont read, think, challenge or hear opposing views\r\n\r\nTrump is doing this in America. Those of us with some oversight from history can see it happening. Read this brilliant, long essay in the New York magazine to understand how Plato described all this, and it is happening just as he predicted. Trump says he will Make America Great Again, when in fact America is currently great, according to pretty well any statistics. He is using passion, anger and rhetoric in the same way all his predecessors did  a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger, creating a cult around himself. You can blame society, politicians, the media, for America getting to the point that its ready for Trump, but the bigger historical picture is that history generally plays out the same way each time someone like him becomes the boss.\r\n\r\nOn a wider stage, zoom out some more, Russia is a dictatorship with a charismatic leader using fear and passion to establish a cult around himself. Turkey is now there too. Hungary, Poland, Slovakia are heading that way, and across Europe more Trumps and Putins are waiting in the wings, in fact funded by Putin, waiting for the popular tide to turn their way.\r\n\r\nWe should be asking ourselves what our Archduke Ferdinand moment will be. How will an apparently small event trigger another period of massive destruction. We see Brexit, Trump, Putin in isolation. The world does not work that way? ? all things are connected and affecting each other. I have pro-Brexit friends who say, Oh, youre going to blame that on Brexit too?? But they dont realize that actually, yes, historians will trace neat lines from apparently unrelated events back to major political and social shifts like Brexit.\r\n\r\nWe are entering a bad phase. It will be unpleasant for those living through it, maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination.\r\nBrexit  a group of angry people winning a fight  easily inspires other groups of angry people to start a similar fight, empowered with the idea that they may win. That alone can trigger chain reactions. A nuclear explosion is not caused by one atom splitting, but by the impact of the first atom that splits causing multiple other atoms near it to split, and they in turn causing multiple atoms to split. The exponential increase in atoms splitting, and their combined energy is the bomb. That is how World War One started and, ironically how World War Two ended.\r\nAn example of how Brexit could lead to a nuclear war could be this:\r\n\r\nBrexit in the UK causes Italy or France to have a similar referendum. Le Pen wins an election in France. Europe now has a fractured EU. The EU, for all its many awful faults, has prevented a war in Europe for longer than ever before. The EU is also a major force in suppressing Putins military ambitions. European sanctions on Russia really hit the economy, and helped temper Russias attacks on Ukraine (there is a reason bad guys always want a weaker European Union). Trump wins in the US. Trump becomes isolationist, which weakens NATO. He has already said he would not automatically honor NATO commitments in the face of a Russian attack on the Baltics.\r\n\r\nWith a fractured EU, and weakened NATO, Putin, facing an ongoing economic and social crisis in Russia, needs another foreign distraction around which to rally his people. He funds far right anti-EU activists in Latvia, who then create a reason for an uprising of the Russian Latvians in the East of the country (the EU border with Russia). Russia sends peace keeping forces and aid lorries into Latvia, as it did in Georgia, and in Ukraine. He cedes Eastern Latvia as he did Eastern Ukraine (Crimea has the same population as Latvia, by the way).\r\n\r\nA divided Europe, with the leaders of France, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and others now pro-Russia, anti-EU, and funded by Putin, overrule calls for sanctions or a military response. NATO is slow to respond: Trump does not want America to be involved, and a large part of Europe is indifferent or blocking any action. Russia, seeing no real resistance to their actions, move further into Latvia, and then into Eastern Estonia and Lithuania. The Baltic States declare war on Russia and start to retaliate, as they have now been invaded so have no choice. Half of Europe sides with them, a few countries remain neutral, and a few side with Russia. Where does Turkey stand on this? How does ISIS respond to a new war in Europe? Who uses a nuclear weapon first?\r\n\r\nThis is just one Arch Duke Ferdinand scenario. The number of possible scenarios are infinite due to the massive complexity of the many moving parts. And of course many of them lead to nothing happening. But based on history we are due another period of destruction, and based on history all the indicators are that we are entering one.\r\n\r\nIt will come in ways we cant see coming, and will spin out of control so fast people wont be able to stop it. Historians will look back and make sense of it all and wonder how we could all have been so nave. How could I sit in a nice caf in London, writing this, without wanting to run away. How could people read it and make sarcastic and dismissive comments about how pro-Remain people should stop whining, and how we shouldnt blame everything on Brexit. Others will read this and sneer at me for saying America is in great shape, that Trump is a possible future Hitler (and yes, Godwins Law. But my comparison is to another narcissistic, charismatic leader fanning flames of hatred until things spiral out of control). Its easy to jump to conclusions that oppose pessimistic predictions based on the weight of history and learning. Trump won against the other Republicans in debates by countering their claims by calling them names and dismissing them. Its an easy route but the wrong one.\r\n\r\nIgnoring and mocking the experts, as people are doing around Brexit and Trumps campaign, is no different to ignoring a doctor who tells you to stop smoking, and then finding later youve developed incurable cancer. A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if youd listened and thought a bit. But people smoke, and people die from it. That is the way of the human.\r\n\r\nWe need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups, try to cross the ever widening social divides.\r\nSo I feel its all inevitable. I dont know what it will be, but we are entering a bad phase. It will be unpleasant for those living through it, maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination. Humans will come out the other side, recover and move on. The human race will be fine, changed, maybe better. But for those at the sharp end  for the thousands of Turkish teachers who just got fired, for the Turkish journalists and lawyers in prison, for the Russian dissidents in gulags, for people lying wounded in French hospitals after terrorist attacks, for those yet to fall, this will be their Somme.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do? Well, again, looking back, probably not much. The liberal intellectuals are always in the minority. See Clay Shirkys Twitter Storm on this point. The people who see that open societies, being nice to other people, not being racist, not fighting wars, is a better way to live, they generally end up losing these fights. They dont fight dirty. They are terrible at appealing to the populace. They are less violent, so end up in prisons, camps, and graves. We need to beware not to become divided (see: Labour party), we need to avoid getting lost in arguing through facts and logic, and counter the populist messages of passion and anger with our own similar messages. We need to understand and use social media.\r\n\r\nWe need to harness a different fear. Fear of another World War nearly stopped World War 2, but didnt. We need to avoid our own echo chambers. Trump and Putin supporters dont read the Guardian, so writing there is just reassuring our friends. We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups, try to cross the ever widening social divides.\r\n\r\n(Perhaps Im just writing this so I can be remembered by history as one of the people who saw it coming.)",

    "text": "Some time ago, Hillary Clinton and her advisers decided that the best course of action was to apologize for having used a personal email address to conduct government business while serving as secretary of state. Clinton herself was, clearly, not really all that remorseful about this, and it showed in her early efforts to address it. Eventually aides prevailed upon her to express a greater degree of regret, which they hoped would lay the issue to rest.\r\n\r\nIt did not. Instead, email-related talk has dogged Clinton throughout the election and it has influenced public perceptions of her in an overwhelmingly negative way. July polling showed 56 percent of Americans believed Clinton broke the law by relying on a personal email address with another 36 percent piling on to say the episode showed bad judgments albeit not criminality.\r\n\r\nBecause Clinton herself apologized for it and because it does not appear to be in any way important, Clinton allies, surrogates, and co-partisans have largely not familiarized themselves with the details of the matter, instead saying vaguely that it was an error of judgment and she apologized and America has bigger fish to fry.\r\n\r\nThis has had the effect of further inscribing and reinscribing the notion that Clinton did something wrong, meaning that every bit of micro-news that puts the scandal back on cable amounts to reminding people of something bad that Clinton did. In total, network newscasts have, remarkably, dedicated more airtime to coverage of Clintons emails than to all policy issues combined.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate because emailgate, like so many Clinton pseudo-scandals before it, is bullshit. The real scandal here is the way a story that was at best of modest significance came to dominate the US presidential election  overwhelming stories of much more importance, giving the American people a completely skewed impression of one of the two nominees, and creating space for the FBI to intervene in the election in favor of its apparently preferred candidate in a dangerous way.\r\n\r\nWhy Hillary Clinton used a personal email account\r\nWhen Hillary Clinton took office as secretary of state, she, like most people, already had a personal email account. Like most people who started a federal job in 2009, she was also disheartened to learn that the then-current state of federal IT departments was such that she could not connect her personal smartphone to a State Department email address. If she wanted ready access to both her email accounts, she would need to carry two smartphones.\r\n\r\nAs any reporter in Washington knows, this indignity was in fact visited upon a huge number of DC denizens for many years. Everyone working in government felt that this was kinda bullshit, but nobody could really do anything about it. (Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts has opined that carrying two phones could be reasonable grounds to suspect someone is a drug dealer.)\r\n\r\nClinton decided to do something about it. Namely, she told her top aides to just email her at her personal address so she could keep using whichever devices she wanted. This violated an internal State Department policy directive, known as a Foreign Affairs Manual, which stated that while it was okay to use personal digital devices to do work occasionally, normal day-to-day operations should be conducted on standard State Department equipment. Clinton chose to ignore this guideline and because she was the boss nobody could stop her. Career foreign service officers and other State personnel have every right to be peeved that Clinton opted out of an annoying policy rather than fixing the underlying issue, but its hardly a matter of overwhelming public concern.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, it turns out Colin Powell also used a private email address for routine work. Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright didnt use email, and back before Albright only weird nerds even knew what email was. So at the time Clinton took office, only one previous secretary of state had ever faced the question of what email account to use, and he reached the exact same conclusion Clinton did  just use your personal email address.\r\n\r\nWhy Hillary used a private email server\r\nWhen Hillary tried the eminently sensible I was following precedent defense, Politifact dinged her answer as mostly false on the grounds that while Powell did use a personal email account, he didnt use a private email server.\r\n\r\nThis distinction has attracted a lot of attention. And its proven politically damaging  because while lots of people maintain two email addresses and sometimes do work stuff on their personal email, very few Americans use a private email server as opposed to relying on a commercial email service. But legally speaking, this is completely irrelevant. As the State Department inspector general concluded in its report on Clintons conduct, the guideline Clinton violated was a principle that normal day-to-day operations should be conducted on an authorized Automated Information System.\r\n\r\nUsing a private server violates that rule, but so would using a Gmail address or simply checking your State.gov email address from your personal laptop rather than a Department-issue one.\r\n\r\nBut while the use of a private server is legally irrelevant, its certainly unusual. And it leaves people wondering: Why did Clinton go out of her way to set up a private server?\r\n\r\nClinton, as you may have heard, is married to former president Bill Clinton, who stepped down from office in January of 2001. Clinton was in the White House throughout the 1990s when the rest of us were being bombarded with AOL signup CD-ROMs, so he didnt have a personal email when he left. Gmail didnt exist back then, and his new job was, in effect, running a Bill Clinton startup. He launched a charitable foundation, he established his presidential library, and he made big bucks on speaking tours. He had a staff and he needed IT infrastructure and support. So he paid a guy to set up an email server that he could use.\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton  who is, again, his wife  also set herself up with an account on the same server. This is a bit unusual, but a lot about being married to a former president is unusual. What its not is suspicious.\r\n\r\nThe private server was not a transparency dodge\r\nIts become a bit of an article of faith among journalists frustrated with public officials constant FOIA-dodging that this is all obviously dissimulation and Clinton was really trying to evade the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nMany people, for example, point to the fact that Clinton would routinely travel with multiple digital devices as debunking her supposed convenience argument. But this is silly. Ive been known to travel with an iPhone, an iPad, a Kindle, and a laptop all at once. That doesnt mean needing to carry two separate iPhones (one to check my work email and one to check my personal email) wouldnt be inconvenient. After all, what if I was replying to a work email while a text came in to my personal phone and I wanted to check it.\r\n\r\nId be left juggling phones and looking like an idiot, exactly how federal employees tended to look in the heyday of the double-fisting phones era.\r\n\r\nI would not want to do that. Colin Powell did not want to do that. Hillary Clinton did not want to do that. Because that would be terrible.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, its a terrible solution to a desire to avoid having your emails disclosed to the public via FOIA. One way you can tell its a terrible solution is that Hillary Clintons work emails have been disclosed to the public. You can read them right here.\r\n\r\nThe specific timeline is that the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested Clintons emails in the summer of 2014, at which point the relevant State Department personnel realized they did not have the emails because Clinton had been using her personal address. State asked Clinton for the emails, and she handed them over later that year. It was only in March of 2015 that the New York Times broke the story of Clintons personal email account in a scoop by Michael Schmidt (the server was reported a few days later by the AP)*, which reported that the emails had been handed over to the State Department two months ago.\r\n\r\nThis is fairly clearly not an optimal approach to government record-keeping, as Thomas Blanton of the National Security Archive at George Washington University told Schmidt at the time:\r\n\r\nIts a shame it didnt take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have. Someone in the State Department deserves credit for taking the initiative to ask for the records back. Most of the time it takes the threat of litigation and embarrassment.\r\nAccording to the Inspector Generals report, Clinton should have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible interpretations here. One is that Clinton hatched the private email account plan as an elaborate dodge of federal record-keeping laws, but then months before the public became aware of the servers existence complied with requests to turn them over. The other is that the federal records rule on the book was antiquated and a bit absurd, requiring officials to turn over paper copies of emails for no good reason, and simply got ignored out of sloppiness.\r\n\r\nBut she deleted 33,000 emails!\r\nSuspicion at this point is then supposed to focus on the fact that she had her lawyers delete more than 30,000 emails from her server.\r\n\r\nAfter Hillary left office, the State Department told her she had to turn all her work-related emails over to them, so she tasked a legal team with determining which emails were work emails and which were not. She turned the work emails over because thats what she was legally required to do. She deleted the others, presumably because she did not want Trey Gowdy and Jason Chaffetz to rummage through her inbox leaking whatever they happened to find amusing to area journalists.\r\n\r\nNow, is it possible that Clintons legal team simply decided to entirely disregard the law and delete work-related emails?\r\n\r\nIn some sense, sure. But theres no evidence that this happened. Generally speaking, in life we assume it would be moderately difficult to hire a well-known law firm to destroy evidence for you without someone deciding to do the right thing and squeal.\r\n\r\nBesides which, it would be almost comically easy to catch Clinton in the act of systematically destroying relevant emails. The vast majority of the work-related email correspondence of an incumbent secretary of state, after all, is going to be correspondence with other government employees. Maybe she shoots a note to the Pentagon about Benghazi, or circulates ideas for a speech draft with her communications team. Any message like that, by definition, would exist on a government server as well as on her private one. This means it would be fully accessible via FOIA and also means that if Clintons copy were found to not be in the pile of emails she turned over, shed be caught red handed.\r\n\r\nThe available FOIA workarounds are available to everyone\r\nNow whats true is that Clinton could, in theory, have conducted work-related email conversations using another persons personal email address.\r\n\r\nShe could, for instance, have emailed Jake Sullivan on his Gmail address then deleted the email from her private server. Wed be in the dark and shed get away with it.\r\n\r\nThe key thing to note here, however, is that the availability of this option has nothing to do with Clintons decision to use a personal account as her exclusive account and also has nothing to do with her decision to host her personal email on a private server.\r\n\r\nAt any given time, any federal employee can use her personal account to email any other federal employee at his personal account. If they receive a Freedom of Information Act request, they are legally obligated to hand that correspondence over. But in a practical sense, if they want to break the law they can probably get away with it. And as Ezra Klein has noted, there are a lot of workarounds here:\r\n\r\nAs every reporter knows, when official sources want to tell you something particularly delicate, they email you from a personal account  or, much more often, they call.\r\n\r\nA lot of my reporting happens by email. But virtually none of my reporting with the White House happens by email. There, emails for clarification, or comment, quickly lead to phone calls. The reason  unsaid but obvious  is that phone calls don't leave an official record. White House officials can talk freely on the phone in a way they can't over email.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the White House keeps a visitor's log. If you make an appointment to meet with someone, your entrance and point of contact are recorded for posterity and searchable online. When someone who shouldn't be meeting with you wants to meet with you, they tend to suggest an off-site location: a restaurant downtown, or a nearby coffee shop. Peet's Coffee doesn't keep a list of everyone who walks in or out.\r\nWe do not, however, generally treat all federal employees as having a massive ethical cloud over their heads just because they could probably use this workaround to break the law. There is zero reason to apply heightened scrutiny to Clinton just because she also could break the law.\r\n\r\nBesides which, when you are secretary of state there is a much simpler and easier way to mask your correspondence: classification.\r\n\r\nHere, for example, is an email Sullivan sent to Clinton on June 4, 2011, that was duly handed over to the State Department and made available by the FOIA office:\r\n\r\n \r\nIm not saying the contents of that message dont deserve to be redacted for security purposes. The fact is that I have no idea. But the reality is the American national security state is really, really good at using official channels to avoid disclosure of information. Nobody needs a private email server to pull that off.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the allegation that the server setup was an elaborate con to evade transparency law is doubly ridiculous. On the one hand, a private server would not be necessary to carry it out. (All you need is to have a private email address on the side, which everyone does.) While on the other hand, the exclusive use of a personal email account means that Clintons personal account has come under an exceptional level of security.\r\n\r\nThe classification thing is a red herring\r\nIts precisely because nothing about the basic setup of the email account was in any way wrong that the investigation ended up focusing on the question of mishandling classified information.\r\n\r\nThe key point here is that using a State.gov email account would not have changed anything. When US government officials have conversations about classified matters, they are not supposed to use email. They are supposed to use special secure channels.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, mistakes happen in part because classification standards are vague and ever-changing. Technically speaking, forwarding a Washington Post article detailing things revealed by Edward Snowden could constitute an improper discussion of classified matters.\r\n\r\nAs FBI Director James Comey concluded, no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against Clinton over this matter. Almost all of the relevant statutes require an intent to mishandle classified information in order to bring a prosecution, a standard that Clintons conduct clearly does not meet. Critics have thus chosen to focus on 18 USC  793, a statute that sets a lower gross negligence standard.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Jack Goldsmith, one of the top lawyers in George W. Bushs administration explains, such a prosecution would be entirely novel, and would turn in part on very tricky questions about how email exchanges fit into language written with physical removal of classified information in mind.\r\n\r\nBen Wittes, a veteran legal journalist and Brookings fellow who has spent the past several years specializing in national security law, wrote that Comeys characterization was clearly correct:\r\n\r\nFor the last several months, people have been asking me what I thought the chances of an indictment were. I have said each time that there is no chance without evidence of bad faith action of some kind. People simply don't get indicted for accidental, non-malicious mishandling of classified material. I have followed leak cases for a very long time, both at the Washington Post and since starting Lawfare. I have never seen a criminal matter proceed without even an allegation of something more than mere mishandling of sensitive information. Hillary Clinton is not above the law, but to indict her on these facts, she'd have to be significantly below the law.\r\nIts true that to a layman the Espionage Acts reference to gross negligence sounds similar to Comeys characterization of Clintons actions as extremely careless. But as Philip Zelikow, a counselor to Condoleezza Rice during the Bush administration and currently the Director of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia explains, they only sound alike unless you do a tiny bit of homework on the history and caselaw of the Statute.\r\n\r\nDid Hillary Clinton do something criminal with her emails? Philip Zelikow walks you through. #election2016 @AnnCompton @pastpunditry pic.twitter.com/kS8Z4dq9Qf\r\n\r\n Miller Center (@Miller_Center) November 3, 2016\r\nAs the Cato Institutes Julian Sanchez writes, attempting a prosecution for non-malicious mishandling would likely result in the statute being held unconstitutional: the Supreme Courts opinion in Gorin v. United States (1941), which suggests that the Espionage Acts intent requirements are an important feature that save it from unconstitutional vagueness.\r\n\r\nThis legal analysis is important because it makes it clear that even if the Weiner laptop emails arent simply client-side copies of the exact emails the FBI already has, there is essentially no chance it will change the ultimate verdict. The reason Clinton isnt getting locked up is that there was no malign intent. Finding another email with classified information on it wont change that conclusion.\r\n\r\nA bullshit scandal amidst a serious election\r\nNetwork newscasts have, remarkably, dedicated more airtime to coverage of Clintons emails than to all policy issues combined.\r\n\r\nCable news has been, if anything, worse, and many prestige outlets have joined the pileup. One malign result of obsessive email coverage is that the public is left totally unaware of the policy stakes in the election. Another is that the constant vague recitations of the phrase Clinton email scandal have firmly implanted the notion that there is something scandalous about anything involving Hillary Clinton and email, including her campaign manager getting hacked or the revelation that one of her aides sometimes checked mail on her husbands computer.\r\n\r\nBut none of this is true. Clinton broke no laws according to the FBI itself. Her setup gave her no power to evade federal transparency laws beyond what anyone who has a personal email account of any kind has. Her stated explanation for her conduct is entirely believable, fits the facts perfectly, and is entirely plausible to anyone who doesn't simply start with the assumption that she's guilty of something.\r\n\r\nGiven Powells conduct, Clinton wasn't even breaking with an informal precedent. The very worst you can say is that, faced with an annoying government IT policy, she used her stature to find a personal workaround rather than a systemic fix that would work for everyone. To spend so much time on such a trivial matter would be absurd in a city council race, much less a presidential election. To do so in circumstances when it advances the electoral prospects of a rival who has shattered all precedents in terms of lacking transparency or basic honesty is infinitely more scandalous than anything related to the server itself.",

    "text": "As the father of three daughters, I reserved the right to interview their dates. Seemed only fair to me. After all, my wife and Id spent 16 or 17 years feeding them, dressing them, funding braces and driving them to volleyball tournaments and piano recitals. A five-minute face-to-face with the guy was a fair expectation. For the next few hours, she would be affected by his ability to drive a car, avoid the bad crowds and stay sober. I wanted to know if he could do it. I wanted to know if he was decent.\r\n\r\nThis was my word: decent. Would he treat my daughter with kindness and respect? Could he be trusted to bring her home on time? In his language, actions and decisions, would he be a decent guy?\r\n\r\nDecency mattered to me as a dad, and decency matters to Americans. We take note of the person who pays their debts. We appreciate the physician who takes time to listen. When the husband honors his wedding vows, when the teacher makes time for the struggling student, when the employee refuses to gossip about her co-worker, when the losing team congratulates the winning team, we can characterize their behavior as decent.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate decency. We applaud decency. We teach decency. We seek to develop decency.\r\n\r\nSo why isnt decency doing better in the presidential race?\r\n\r\nThe leading Republican candidate to be the next leader of the free world would not pass my decency interview. Id send him away. Id tell my daughter to stay home.\r\n\r\nI dont know Mr. Trump. But Ive been chagrined at his antics. He ridiculed a war hero. He made a mockery of a reporters menstrual cycle. He made fun of a disabled reporter. He referred to a former first lady, Barbara Bush, as mommy and belittled Jeb Bush for bringing her on the campaign trail. He routinely calls people stupid and dummy. One writer catalogued 64 occasions that he called someone loser. These were not off-line, backstage, overheard, not-to-be-repeated comments. They were publicly and intentionally tweeted, recorded and presented.\r\n\r\nSuch insensitivities wouldnt be acceptable even for a middle school student body election. But for the Oval Office? And to do so while brandishing a Bible and boasting of his Christian faith?\r\n\r\nI have no inside track on the intricacies of a presidential campaign. Im a pastor. I dont endorse candidates or place bumper stickers on my car. But I am protective of the Christian faith. If a public personality calls on Christ one day and calls someone a bimbo the next, is something not awry? And to do so, not once, but repeatedly, unrepentantly and unapologetically? We stand against bullying in schools. Shouldnt we do the same in presidential politics?\r\n\r\nCould concerns be raised about other Christian candidates? Absolutely. But the concern of this article is not policy but tone and decorum. Prior presidents have exercised a restraint of the tongue. Its hard to imagine George H.W. Bush using locker room language to demean an opponent on a debate stage. I didnt vote for President Obama, but I appreciate the manner in which he has maintained the comportment of the office. At least we dont wince when he stands to speak.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to language, Mr. Trump inhabits a league of his own. Some of my friends tell me that his language is a virtue. But I respectfully part company with my Christian colleagues who chalk up his abrasive nature to candor. For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks, Jesus said. Words are a heart monitor. Christians would do well to summon any Christian leader to a higher heart standard. This includes pastors (especially this one), teachers, coaches and, by all means, presidential candidates.\r\n\r\nAll of them.\r\n\r\nThe stock explanation for Mr. Trumps success is this: He has tapped into the anger of the American people. As one man said, We are voting with our middle finger. Sounds more like a comment for a gang-fight than a presidential election. Anger-fueled reactions have caused trouble ever since Cain was angry at Abel.\r\n\r\nWe can only hope, and pray, for a return to verbal decency. Perhaps Mr. Trump will better manage his comments. (Worthy of a prayer, for sure.) Or, perhaps the American public will remember the key role of the president: to be the face of America. When he or she speaks, he or she speaks for us. Whether we agree or disagree with the policies of the president, do we not hope that they speak in a way that is consistent with the status of the office?\r\n\r\nAs far as I remember, I never turned away one of my daughters dates. They werent perfect, but they were decent fellows. That was all I could ask.\r\n\r\nIt seems that we should ask the same of these candidates.",

    "text": "The American media, over the past year, has been trying to work out something of a mystery: Why is the Republican electorate supporting a far-right, orange-toned populist with no real political experience, who espouses extreme and often bizarre views? How has Donald Trump, seemingly out of nowhere, suddenly become so popular?\r\n\r\nWhat's made Trump's rise even more puzzling is that his support seems to cross demographic lines  education, income, age, even religiosity  that usually demarcate candidates. And whereas most Republican candidates might draw strong support from just one segment of the party base, such as Southern evangelicals or coastal moderates, Trump currently does surprisingly well from the Gulf Coast of Florida to the towns of upstate New York, and he won a resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses.\r\n\r\nTable of contents\r\nI. What is American authoritarianism?\r\nII. The discovery\r\nIII. How authoritarianism works\r\nIV. What can authoritarianism explain?\r\nV. The party of authoritarians\r\nVI. Trump, authoritarians, and fear\r\nVII. America's changing social landscape \r\nVIII. What authoritarians want \r\nIX. How authoritarians will change American politics \r\nPerhaps strangest of all, it wasn't just Trump but his supporters who seemed to have come out of nowhere, suddenly expressing, in large numbers, ideas far more extreme than anything that has risen to such popularity in recent memory. In South Carolina, a CBS News exit poll found that 75 percent of Republican voters supported banning Muslims from the United States. A PPP poll found that a third of Trump voters support banning gays and lesbians from the country. Twenty percent said Lincoln shouldn't have freed the slaves.\r\n\r\nLast September, a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst named Matthew MacWilliams realized that his dissertation research might hold the answer to not just one but all three of these mysteries.\r\n\r\nMacWilliams studies authoritarianism  not actual dictators, but rather a psychological profile of individual voters that is characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders. People who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear.\r\n\r\nSo MacWilliams naturally wondered if authoritarianism might correlate with support for Trump.\r\n\r\nHe polled a large sample of likely voters, looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism. What he found was astonishing: Not only did authoritarianism correlate, but it seemed to predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator. He later repeated the same poll in South Carolina, shortly before the primary there, and found the same results, which he published in Vox:\r\n\r\n  \r\nAs it turns out, MacWilliams wasn't the only one to have this realization. Miles away, in an office at Vanderbilt University, a professor named Marc Hetherington was having his own aha moment. He realized that he and a fellow political scientist, the University of North Carolina's Jonathan Weiler, had essentially predicted Trump's rise back in 2009, when they discovered something that would turn out to be far more significant than they then realized.\r\n\r\nThat year, Hetherington and Weiler published a book about the effects of authoritarianism on American politics. Through a series of experiments and careful data analysis, they had come to a surprising conclusion: Much of the polarization dividing American politics was fueled not just by gerrymandering or money in politics or the other oft-cited variables, but by an unnoticed but surprisingly large electoral group  authoritarians.\r\n\r\nTheir book concluded that the GOP, by positioning itself as the party of traditional values and law and order, had unknowingly attracted what would turn out to be a vast and previously bipartisan population of Americans with authoritarian tendencies.\r\n\r\nThis trend had been accelerated in recent years by demographic and economic changes such as immigration, which \"activated\" authoritarian tendencies, leading many Americans to seek out a strongman leader who would preserve a status quo they feel is under threat and impose order on a world they perceive as increasingly alien.\r\n\r\nTrump embodies the classic authoritarian leadership style: simple, powerful, and punitive\r\nThese Americans with authoritarian views, they found, were sorting into the GOP, driving polarization. But they were also creating a divide within the party, at first latent, between traditional Republican voters and this group whose views were simultaneously less orthodox and, often, more extreme.\r\n\r\nOver time, Hetherington and Weiler had predicted, that sorting would become more and more pronounced. And so it was all but inevitable that, eventually, authoritarians would gain enough power within the GOP to make themselves heard.\r\n\r\nAt the time, even Hetherington and Weiler did not realize the explosive implications: that their theory, when followed to its natural conclusion, predicted a looming and dramatic transformation of American politics. But looking back now, the ramifications of their research seem disturbingly clear.\r\n\r\nAuthoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate, to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change, and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force. They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things. And the extreme nature of authoritarians' fears, and of their desire to challenge threats with force, would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics  and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable norms.\r\n\r\nA candidate like Donald Trump.\r\n\r\n Donald Trump\r\n(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\r\nEven Hetherington was shocked to discover quite how right their theory had been. In the early fall of 2015, as Trump's rise baffled most American journalists and political scientists, he called Weiler. He asked, over and over, \"Can you believe this? Can you believe this?\"\r\n\r\nThis winter, I got in touch with Hetherington, MacWilliams, and several other political scientists who study authoritarianism. I wanted to better understand the theory that seemed to have predicted, with such eerie accuracy, Trump's rise. And, like them, I wanted to find out what the rise of authoritarian politics meant for American politics. Was Trump just the start of something bigger?\r\n\r\nThese political scientists were, at that moment, beginning to grapple with the same question. We agreed there was something important happening here  that was just beginning to be understood.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics\r\nShortly after the Iowa Republican caucus, in which Trump came in a close second, Vox partnered with the Washington-based media and polling company Morning Consult to test American authoritarians along a range of political and social views  and to test some hypotheses we had developed after speaking with the leading political scientists of the field.\r\n\r\nWhat we found is a phenomenon that explains, with remarkable clarity, the rise of Donald Trump  but that is also much larger than him, shedding new light on some of the biggest political stories of the past decade. Trump, it turns out, is just the symptom. The rise of American authoritarianism is transforming the Republican Party and the dynamics of national politics, with profound consequences likely to extend well beyond this election.\r\n\r\nI. What is American authoritarianism?\r\n A Trump supporter carries a sign saying \"Build the wall\"\r\nAndrew Renneisen/Getty Images\r\nFor years now, before anyone thought a person like Donald Trump could possibly lead a presidential primary, a small but respected niche of academic research has been laboring over a question, part political science and part psychology, that had captivated political scientists since the rise of the Nazis.\r\n\r\nHow do people come to adopt, in such large numbers and so rapidly, extreme political views that seem to coincide with fear of minorities and with the desire for a strongman leader?\r\n\r\nTo answer that question, these theorists study what they call authoritarianism: not the dictators themselves, but rather the psychological profile of people who, under the right conditions, will desire certain kinds of extreme policies and will seek strongman leaders to implement them.\r\n\r\nThe political phenomenon we identify as right-wing populism seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed\r\nAfter an early period of junk science in the mid-20th century, a more serious group of scholars has addressed this question, specifically studying how it plays out in American politics: researchers like Hetherington and Weiler, Stanley Feldman, Karen Stenner, and Elizabeth Suhay, to name just a few.\r\n\r\nThe field, after a breakthrough in the early 1990s, has come to develop the contours of a grand theory of authoritarianism, culminating quite recently, in 2005, with Stenner's seminal The Authoritarian Dynamic  just in time for that theory to seemingly come true, more rapidly and in greater force than any of them had imagined, in the personage of one Donald Trump and his norm-shattering rise.\r\n\r\nAccording to Stenner's theory, there is a certain subset of people who hold latent authoritarian tendencies. These tendencies can be triggered or \"activated\" by the perception of physical threats or by destabilizing social change, leading those individuals to desire policies and leaders that we might more colloquially call authoritarian.\r\n\r\nIt is as if, the NYU professor Jonathan Haidt has written, a button is pushed that says, \"In case of moral threat, lock down the borders, kick out those who are different, and punish those who are morally deviant.\"\r\n\r\nAuthoritarians are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump  and will persist as a force in American politics\r\nAuthoritarians prioritize social order and hierarchies, which bring a sense of control to a chaotic world. Challenges to that order  diversity, influx of outsiders, breakdown of the old order  are experienced as personally threatening because they risk upending the status quo order they equate with basic security.\r\n\r\nThis is, after all, a time of social change in America. The country is becoming more diverse, which means that many white Americans are confronting race in a way they have never had to before. Those changes have been happening for a long time, but in recent years they have become more visible and harder to ignore. And they are coinciding with economic trends that have squeezed working-class white people.\r\n\r\nWhen they face physical threats or threats to the status quo, authoritarians support policies that seem to offer protection against those fears. They favor forceful, decisive action against things they perceive as threats. And they flock to political leaders who they believe will bring this action.\r\n\r\nIf you were to read every word these theorists ever wrote on authoritarians, and then try to design a hypothetical candidate to match their predictions of what would appeal to authoritarian voters, the result would look a lot like Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nBut political scientists say this theory explains much more than just Donald Trump, placing him within larger trends in American politics: polarization, the rightward shift of the Republican Party, and the rise within that party of a dissident faction challenging GOP orthodoxies and upending American politics.\r\n\r\nMore than that, authoritarianism reveals the connections between several seemingly disparate stories about American politics. And it suggest that a combination of demographic, economic, and political forces, by awakening this authoritarian class of voters that has coalesced around Trump, have created what is essentially a new political party within the GOP  a phenomenon that broke into public view with the 2016 election but will persist long after it has ended.\r\n\r\nII. The discovery: how a niche subfield of political science suddenly became some of the most relevant research in American politics\r\n Buttons for sale on the day of the 2016 Iowa caucuses\r\nBrendan Hoffman/Getty Images\r\nButtons for sale on the day of the 2016 Iowa caucuses.\r\nThis study of authoritarianism began shortly after World War II, as political scientists and psychologists in the US and Europe tried to figure out how the Nazis had managed to win such wide public support for such an extreme and hateful ideology.\r\n\r\nThat was a worthy field of study, but the early work wasn't particularly rigorous by today's standards. The critical theorist Theodor Adorno, for instance, developed what he called the \"F-scale,\" which sought to measure \"fascist\" tendencies. The test wasn't accurate. Sophisticated respondents would quickly discover what the \"right\" answers were and game the test. And there was no proof that the personality type it purportedly measured actually supported fascism.\r\n\r\nMore than that, this early research seemed to assume that a certain subset of people were inherently evil or dangerous  an idea that Hetherington and Weiler say is simplistic and wrong, and that they resist in their work. (They acknowledge the label \"authoritarians\" doesn't do much to dispel this, but their efforts to replace it with a less pejorative-sounding term were unsuccessful.)\r\n\r\nIf this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump's ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics?\r\nBut the real problem for researchers was that even if there really were such a thing as an authoritarian psychological profile, how do you measure it? How do you interrogate authoritarian tendencies, which can sometimes be latent? How do you get honest answers on questions that can be sensitive and highly politicized?\r\n\r\nAs Hetherington explained to me, \"There are certain things that you just can't ask people directly. You can't ask people, 'Do you not like black people?' You can't ask people if they're bigots.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time, no one had a solution for this, and the field of study languished.\r\n\r\nThen in the early 1990s, a political scientist named Stanley Feldman changed everything. Feldman, a professor at SUNY Stonybrook, believed authoritarianism could be an important factor in American politics in ways that had nothing to do with fascism, but that it could only reliably be measured by unlinking it from specific political preferences.\r\n\r\nHe realized that if authoritarianism were a personality profile rather than just a political preference, he could get respondents to reveal these tendencies by asking questions about a topic that seemed much less controversial. He settled on something so banal it seems almost laughable: parenting goals.\r\n\r\nFeldman developed what has since become widely accepted as the definitive measurement of authoritarianism: four simple questions that appear to ask about parenting but are in fact designed to reveal how highly the respondent values hierarchy, order, and conformity over other values.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: independence or respect for elders?\r\nPlease tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: obedience or self-reliance?\r\nPlease tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: to be considerate or to be well-behaved?\r\nPlease tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have: curiosity or good manners?\r\nFeldman's test proved to be very reliable. There was now a way to identify people who fit the authoritarian profile, by prizing order and conformity, for example, and desiring the imposition of those values.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Feldman convinced the National Election Study, a large survey of American voters conducted in each national election year, to include his four authoritarianism questions. Ever since, political scientists who study authoritarianism have accumulated a wealth of data on who exhibits those tendencies and on how they align with everything from demographic profiles to policy preferences.\r\n\r\nWhat they found was impossible to ignore  and is only just beginning to reshape our understanding of the American electorate.\r\n\r\nIII. How authoritarianism works\r\n A Tea Party supporter holds a sign asking \"Obama where's your papers\"\r\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\r\nA 2010 protest against President Obama.\r\nIn the early 2000s, as researchers began to make use of the NES data to understand how authoritarianism affected US politics, their work revealed three insights that help explain not just the rise of Trump, but seemingly a half-century of American political dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe first was Hetherington and Weiler's insight into partisan polarization. In the 1960s, the Republican Party had reinvented itself as the party of law, order, and traditional values  a position that naturally appealed to order- and tradition-focused authoritarians. Over the decades that followed, authoritarians increasingly gravitated toward the GOP, where their concentration gave them more and more influence over time.\r\n\r\nThe second was Stenner's theory of \"activation.\" In an influential 2005 book called The Authoritarian Dynamic, Stenner argued that many authoritarians might be latent  that they might not necessarily support authoritarian leaders or policies until their authoritarianism had been \"activated.\"\r\n\r\nThe social threat theory helps explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same-sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them\r\nThis activation could come from feeling threatened by social changes such as evolving social norms or increasing diversity, or any other change that they believe will profoundly alter the social order they want to protect. In response, previously more moderate individuals would come to support leaders and policies we might now call Trump-esque.\r\n\r\nOther researchers, like Hetherington, take a slightly different view. They believe that authoritarians aren't \"activated\"  they've always held their authoritarian preferences  but that they only come to express those preferences once they feel threatened by social change or some kind of threat from outsiders.\r\n\r\nBut both schools of thought agree on the basic causality of authoritarianism. People do not support extreme policies and strongman leaders just out of an affirmative desire for authoritarianism, but rather as a response to experiencing certain kinds of threats.\r\n\r\nThe third insight came from Hetherington and American University professor Elizabeth Suhay, who found that when non-authoritarians feel sufficiently scared, they also start to behave, politically, like authoritarians.\r\n\r\nBut Hetherington and Suhay found a distinction between physical threats such as terrorism, which could lead non-authoritarians to behave like authoritarians, and more abstract social threats, such as eroding social norms or demographic changes, which do not have that effect. That distinction would turn out to be important, but it also meant that in times when many Americans perceived imminent physical threats, the population of authoritarians could seem to swell rapidly.\r\n\r\nTogether, those three insights added up to one terrifying theory: that if social change and physical threats coincided at the same time, it could awaken a potentially enormous population of American authoritarians, who would demand a strongman leader and the extreme policies necessary, in their view, to meet the rising threats.\r\n\r\nThis theory would seem to predict the rise of an American political constituency that looks an awful lot like the support base that has emerged, seemingly out of nowhere, to propel Donald Trump from sideshow loser of the 2012 GOP primary to runaway frontrunner in 2016.\r\n\r\nBeyond being almost alarmingly prescient, this theory speaks to an oft-stated concern about Trump: that what's scariest is not the candidate, but rather the extent and fervor of his support.\r\n\r\nAnd it raises a question: If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump's ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics? And what effect could it have even after the 2016 race has ended?\r\n\r\nIV. What can authoritarianism explain?\r\n Trump greets supporters in Alabama\r\nMark Wallheiser/Getty Images\r\nIn early February, shortly after Trump finished second in the Iowa caucus and ended any doubts about his support, I began talking to Feldman, Hetherington, and MacWilliams to try to answer these questions.\r\n\r\nMacWilliams had already demonstrated a link between authoritarianism and support for Trump. But we wanted to know how else authoritarianism was playing out in American life, from policy positions to party politics to social issues, and what it might mean for America's future.\r\n\r\nIt was time to call Kyle Dropp. Dropp is a political scientist and pollster whom one of my colleagues described as \"the Doogie Howser of polling.\" He does indeed appear jarringly young for a Dartmouth professor. But he is also the co-founder of a media and polling company, Morning Consult, that had worked with Vox on several other projects.\r\n\r\nWhen we approached Morning Consult, Dropp and his colleagues were excited. Dropp was familiar with Hetherington's work and the authoritarianism measure, he said, and was instantly intrigued by how we could test its relevance to the election. Hetherington and the other political scientists were, in turn, eager to more fully explore the theories that had suddenly become much more relevant.\r\n\r\nNon-authoritarians who were sufficiently frightened of threats like terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians\r\nWe put together five sets of questions. The first set, of course, was the test for authoritarianism that Feldman had developed. This would allow us to measure how authoritarianism coincided or didn't with our other sets of questions.\r\n\r\nThe second set asked standard election-season questions on preferred candidates and party affiliation.\r\n\r\nThe third set tested voters' fears of a series of physical threats, ranging from ISIS and Russia to viruses and car accidents.\r\n\r\nThe fourth set tested policy preferences, in an attempt to see how authoritarianism might lead voters to support particular policies.\r\n\r\nIf the research were right, then we'd expect people who scored highly on authoritarianism to express outsize fear of \"outsider\" threats such as ISIS or foreign governments versus other threats. We also expected that non-authoritarians who expressed high levels of fear would be more likely to support Trump. This would speak to physical fears as triggering a kind of authoritarian upsurge, which would in turn lead to Trump support.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election\r\nThe final set of questions was intended to test fear of social change. We asked people to rate a series of social changes  both actual and hypothetical  on a scale of \"very good\" to \"very bad\" for the country. These included same-sex marriage, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and American Muslims building more mosques in US cities.\r\n\r\nIf the theory about social change provoking stress amongst authoritarians turned out to be correct, then authoritarians would be more likely to rate the changes as bad for the country.\r\n\r\nIn the aggregate, we were hoping to do a few things. We wanted to understand who these people are, in simple demographic terms, and to test the basic hypotheses about how authoritarianism, in theory, is supposed to work. We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election: Were they driving certain policy positions, for example?\r\n\r\nWe wanted to better understand the larger forces that had suddenly made authoritarians so numerous and so extreme  was it migration, terrorism, perhaps the decline of working-class whites? And maybe most of all, we wanted to develop some theories about what the rise of American authoritarianism meant for the future of polarization between the parties as well as a Republican Party that had become both more extreme and internally divided.\r\n\r\nAbout 10 days later, shortly after Trump won the New Hampshire primary, the poll went into the field. In less than two weeks, we had our results.\r\n\r\nV. How the GOP became the party of authoritarians\r\n Donald Trump and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sign autographs during a Trump campaign event in Texas\r\nTom Pennington/Getty Images\r\nDonald Trump and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie sign autographs during a Trump campaign event in Texas.\r\nThe first thing that jumped out from the data on authoritarians is just how many there are. Our results found that 44 percent of white respondents nationwide scored as \"high\" or \"very high\" authoritarians, with 19 percent as \"very high.\" That's actually not unusual, and lines up with previous national surveys that found that the authoritarian disposition is far from rare1.\r\n\r\nThe key thing to understand is that authoritarianism is often latent; people in this 44 percent only vote or otherwise act as authoritarians once triggered by some perceived threat, physical or social. But that latency is part of how, over the past few decades, authoritarians have quietly become a powerful political constituency without anyone realizing it.\r\n\r\nToday, according to our survey, authoritarians skew heavily Republican. More than 65 percent of people who scored highest on the authoritarianism questions were GOP voters. More than 55 percent of surveyed Republicans scored as \"high\" or \"very high\" authoritarians.\r\n\r\nAnd at the other end of the scale, that pattern reversed. People whose scores were most non-authoritarian  meaning they always chose the non-authoritarian parenting answer  were almost 75 percent Democrats.\r\n\r\nBut this hasn't always been the case. According to Hetherington and Weiler's research, this is not a story about how Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Venus. It's a story of polarization that increased over time.\r\n\r\nThey trace the trend to the 1960s, when the Republican Party shifted electoral strategies to try to win disaffected Southern Democrats, in part by speaking to fears of changing social norms  for example, the racial hierarchies upset by civil rights. The GOP also embraced a \"law and order\" platform with a heavily racial appeal to white voters who were concerned about race riots.\r\n\r\nThis positioned the GOP as the party of traditional values and social structures  a role that it has maintained ever since. That promise to stave off social change and, if necessary, to impose order happened to speak powerfully to voters with authoritarian inclinations.\r\n\r\nDemocrats, by contrast, have positioned themselves as the party of civil rights, equality, and social progress  in other words, as the party of social change, a position that not only fails to attract but actively repels change-averse authoritarians.\r\n\r\nOver the next several decades, Hetherington explained to me, this led authoritarians to naturally \"sort\" themselves into the Republican Party.\r\n\r\nThat matters, because as more authoritarians sort themselves into the GOP, they have more influence over its policies and candidates. It is not for nothing that our poll found that more than half of the Republican respondents score as authoritarian.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more importantly, the party has less and less ability to ignore authoritarians' voting preferences  even if those preferences clash with the mainstream party establishment.\r\n\r\nVI. Trump, authoritarians, and fear\r\n  \r\nBased on our data, Morning Consult data scientist Adam Petrihos said that \"among Republicans, very high/high authoritarianism is very predictive of support for Trump.\" Trump has 42 percent support among Republicans but, according to our survey, a full 52 percent support among very high authoritarians.\r\n\r\nAuthoritarianism was the best single predictor of support for Trump, although having a high school education also came close. And as Hetherington noted after reviewing our results, the relationship between authoritarianism and Trump support remained robust, even after controlling for education level and gender.\r\n\r\nTrump support was much lower among Republicans who scored low on authoritarianism: only 38 percent.\r\n\r\nBut that's still awfully high. So what could explain Trump's support among non-authoritarians?\r\n\r\nI suspected the answer might lie at least partly in Hetherington and Suhay's research on how fear affects non-authoritarian voters, so I called them to discuss the data. Hetherington crunched some numbers on physical threats and noticed two things.\r\n\r\nThe first was that authoritarians tend to fear very specific kinds of physical threats.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthoritarians, we found in our survey, tend to most fear threats that come from abroad, such as ISIS or Russia or Iran. These are threats, the researchers point out, to which people can put a face; a scary terrorist or an Iranian ayatollah. Non-authoritarians were much less afraid of those threats. For instance, 73 percent of very high-scoring authoritarians believed that terrorist organizations like ISIS posed a \"very high risk\" to them, but only 45 percent of very low-scoring authoritarians did. Domestic threats like car accidents, by contrast, were much less frightening to authoritarians.\r\n\r\nBut Hetherington also noticed something else: A subgroup of non-authoritarians were very afraid of threats like Iran or ISIS. And the more fear of these threats they expressed, the more likely they were to support Trump.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis seemed to confirm his and Suhay's theory: that non-authoritarians who are sufficiently frightened of physical threats such as terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians.\r\n\r\nThat's important, because for years now, Republican politicians and Republican-leaning media such as Fox News have been telling viewers nonstop that the world is a terrifying place and that President Obama isn't doing enough to keep Americans safe.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of political and media incentives for why this happens. But the point is that, as a result, Republican voters have been continually exposed to messages warning of physical dangers. As the perception of physical threat has risen, this fear appears to have led a number of non-authoritarians to vote like authoritarians  to support Trump.\r\n\r\nAn irony of this primary is that the Republican establishment has tried to stop Trump by, among other things, co-opting his message. But when establishment candidates such as Marco Rubio try to match Trump's rhetoric on ISIS or on American Muslims, they may end up deepening the fear that can only lead voters back to Trump.\r\n\r\nVII. Is America's changing social landscape \"activating\" authoritarianism?\r\nBut the research on authoritarianism suggests it's not just physical threats driving all this. There should be another kind of threat  larger, slower, less obvious, but potentially even more powerful  pushing authoritarians to these extremes: the threat of social change.\r\n\r\nThis could come in the form of evolving social norms, such as the erosion of traditional gender roles or evolving standards in how to discuss sexual orientation. It could come in the form of rising diversity, whether that means demographic changes from immigration or merely changes in the colors of the faces on TV. Or it could be any changes, political or economic, that disrupt social hierarchies.\r\n\r\nWhat these changes have in common is that, to authoritarians, they threaten to take away the status quo as they know it  familiar, orderly, secure  and replace it with something that feels scary because it is different and destabilizing, but also sometimes because it upends their own place in society. According to the literature, authoritarians will seek, in response, a strong leader who promises to suppress the scary changes, if necessary by force, and to preserve the status quo.\r\n\r\nThis is why, in our survey, we wanted to study the degree to which authoritarians versus non-authoritarians expressed a fear of social change  and whether this, as expected, led them to desire heavy-handed responses.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOur results seemed to confirm this: Authoritarians were significantly more likely to rate almost all of the actual and hypothetical social issues we asked about as \"bad\" or \"very bad\" for the country.\r\n\r\nFor instance, our results suggested that an astonishing 44 percent of authoritarians believe same-sex marriage is harmful to the country. Twenty-eight percent rated same-sex marriage as \"very bad\" for America, and another 16 percent said that its \"bad.\" Only about 35 percent of high-scoring authoritarians said same-sex marriage was \"good\" or \"very good\" for the country.\r\n\r\nTellingly, non-authoritarians' responses skewed in the opposite direction. Non-authoritarians tended to rate same-sex marriage as \"good\" or \"very good\" for the country.\r\n\r\nThe fact that authoritarians and non-authoritarians split over something as seemingly personal and nonthreatening as same-sex marriage is crucial for understanding how authoritarianism can be triggered by even a social change as minor as expanding marriage rights.\r\n\r\nWe also asked respondents to rate whether Muslims building more mosques in American cities was a good thing. This was intended to test respondents' comfort level with sharing their communities with Muslims  an issue that has been particularly contentious this primary election.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA whopping 56.5 percent of very high-scoring authoritarians said it was either \"bad\" or \"very bad\" for the country when Muslims built more mosques. Only 14 percent of that group said more mosques would be \"good\" or \"very good.\"\r\n\r\nThe literature on authoritarianism suggests this is not just simple Islamophobia, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon wherein authoritarians feel threatened by people they identify as \"outsiders\" and by the possibility of changes to the status quo makeup of their communities.\r\n\r\nThis would help explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same-sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them. What these seemingly disparate groups have in common is the perceived threat they pose to the status quo order, which authoritarians experience as a threat to themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd America is at a point when the status quo social order is changing rapidly; when several social changes are converging. And they are converging especially on working-class white people.\r\n\r\nIt is conventional wisdom to ascribe the rise of first the Tea Party right and now Trump to the notion that working-class white Americans are angry.\r\n\r\nIndeed they are, but this data helps explain that they are also under certain demographic and economic pressures that, according to this research, are highly likely to trigger authoritarianism  and thus suggests there is something a little more complex going on than simple \"anger\" that helps explain their gravitation toward extreme political responses.\r\n\r\nWorking-class communities have come under tremendous economic strain since the recession. And white people are also facing the loss of the privileged position that they previously were able to take for granted. Whites are now projected to become a minority group over the next few decades, owing to migration and other factors. The president is a black man, and nonwhite faces are growing more common in popular culture. Nonwhite groups are raising increasingly prominent political demands, and often those demands coincide with issues such as policing that also speak to authoritarian concerns.\r\n\r\nSome of these factors might be considered more or less legitimately threatening than others  the loss of working-class jobs in this country is a real and important issue, no matter how one feels about fading white privilege  but that is not the point.\r\n\r\nThe point, rather, is that the increasingly important political phenomenon we identify as right-wing populism, or white working-class populism, seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed.\r\n\r\nThat is not to dismiss white working-class concerns as invalid because they might be expressed by authoritarians or through authoritarian politics, but rather to better understand why this is happening  and why it's having such a profound and extreme effect on American politics.\r\n\r\nHave we misunderstood hard-line social conservatism all along?\r\nMost of the other social-threat questions followed a similar pattern2. On its surface, this might seem to suggest that authoritarianism is just a proxy for especially hard-line manifestations of social conservatism. But when examined more carefully, it suggests something more interesting about the nature of social conservatism itself.\r\n\r\nFor liberals, it may be easy to conclude that opposition to things like same-sex marriage, immigration, and diversity is rooted in bigotry against those groups  that it's the manifestation of specific homophobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia.\r\n\r\nBut the results of the Vox/Morning Consult poll, along with prior research on authoritarianism, suggests there might be something else going on.\r\n\r\nThere is no particular reason, after all, why parenting goals should coincide with animus against specific groups. We weren't asking questions about whether it was important for children to respect people of different races, but about whether they should respect authority and rules generally. So why do they coincide so heavily?\r\n\r\nWhat might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner's theory of \"activation\"\r\nWhat is most likely, Hetherington suggested, is that authoritarians are much more susceptible to messages that tell them to fear a specific \"other\"  whether or not they have a preexisting animus against that group. Those fears would therefore change over time as events made different groups seem more or less threatening.\r\n\r\nIt all depends, he said, on whether a particular group of people has been made into an outgroup or not  whether they had been identified as a dangerous other.\r\n\r\nSince September 2001, some media outlets and politicians have painted Muslims as the other and as dangerous to America. Authoritarians, by nature, are more susceptible to these messages, and thus more likely to come to oppose the presence of mosques in their communities.\r\n\r\nWhen told to fear a particular outgroup, Hetherington said, \"On average people who score low in authoritarianism will be like, 'Im not that worried about that,' while people who score high in authoritarianism will be like, 'Oh, my god! Im worried about that, because the world is a dangerous place.'\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, what might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner's theory of \"activation\": that authoritarians are unusually susceptible to messages about the ways outsiders and social changes threaten America, and so lash out at groups that are identified as objects of concern at that given moment.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that such an attitude is in some way better than simple racism or xenophobia  it is still dangerous and damaging, especially if it empowers frightening demagogues like Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more to the point, it helps explain how Trump's supporters have come to so quickly embrace such extreme policies targeting these outgroups: mass deportation of millions of people, a ban on foreign Muslims visiting the US. When you think about those policy preferences as driven by authoritarianism, in which social threats are perceived as especially dangerous and as demanding extreme responses, rather than the sudden emergence of specific bigotries, this starts to make a lot more sense.\r\n\r\nVIII. What authoritarians want\r\nFrom our parenting questions, we learned who the GOP authoritarians are. From our questions about threats and social change, we learned what's motivating them. But the final set of questions, on policy preferences, might be the most important of all: So what? What do authoritarians actually want?\r\n\r\nThe responses to our policy questions showed that authoritarians have their own set of policy preferences, distinct from GOP orthodoxy. And those preferences mean that, in real and important ways, authoritarians are their own distinct constituency: effectively a new political party within the GOP.\r\n\r\nWhat stands out from the results, Feldman wrote after reviewing our data, is that authoritarians \"are most willing to want to use force, to crack down on immigration, and limit civil liberties.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"action side\" of authoritarianism, he believed, was the key thing that distinguished Trump supporters from supporters of other GOP candidates. \"The willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats  that is most clear among Trump supporters.\"\r\n\r\nAuthoritarians generally and Trump voters specifically, we found, were highly likely to support five policies:\r\n\r\nUsing military force over diplomacy against countries that threaten the United States\r\nChanging the Constitution to bar citizenship for children of illegal immigrants\r\nImposing extra airport checks on passengers who appear to be of Middle Eastern descent in order to curb terrorism\r\nRequiring all citizens to carry a national ID card at all times to show to a police officer on request, to curb terrorism\r\nAllowing the federal government to scan all phone calls for calls to any number linked to terrorism\r\nWhat these policies share in common is an outsize fear of threats, physical and social, and, more than that, a desire to meet those threats with severe government action  with policies that are authoritarian not just in style but in actuality. The scale of the desired response is, in some ways, what most distinguishes authoritarians from the rest of the GOP.\r\n\r\n\"Many Republicans seem to be threatened by terrorism, violence, and cultural diversity, but that's not unique to Trump supporters,\" Feldman told me.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to be the action side of authoritarianism  the willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats  that is most clear among Trump supporters,\" he added.\r\n\r\nIf Trump loses the election, that won't remove the threats and social changes that trigger the \"action side\" of authoritarianism\r\nThis helps explain why the GOP has had such a hard time co-opting Trump's supporters, even though those supporters' immediate policy concerns, such as limiting immigration or protecting national security, line up with party orthodoxy. The real divide is over how far to go in responding. And the party establishment is simply unwilling to call for such explicitly authoritarian policies.\r\n\r\nJust as striking is what was missing from authoritarians' concerns. There was no clear correlation between authoritarianism and support for tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 per year, for example. And the same was true of support for international trade agreements.\r\n\r\nThese are both issues associated with mainstream GOP economic policies. All groups opposed the tax cuts, and support for trade agreements was evenly lukewarm across all degrees of authoritarianism. So there is no real divide on these issues.\r\n\r\nBut there is one more factor that our data couldn't capture but is nevertheless important: Trump's style.\r\n\r\nTrump's specific policies aren't the thing that most sets him apart from the rest of the field of GOP candidates. Rather, it's his rhetoric and style. The way he reduces everything to black-and-white extremes of strong versus weak, greatest versus worst. His simple, direct promises that he can solve problems that other politicians are too weak to manage.\r\n\r\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, his willingness to flout all the conventions of civilized discourse when it comes to the minority groups that authoritarians find so threatening. That's why it's a benefit rather than a liability for Trump when he says Mexicans are rapists or speaks gleefully of massacring Muslims with pig-blood-tainted bullets: He is sending a signal to his authoritarian supporters that he won't let \"political correctness\" hold him back from attacking the outgroups they fear.\r\n\r\nThis, Feldman explained to me, is \"classic authoritarian leadership style: simple, powerful, and punitive.\"\r\n\r\nIX. How authoritarians will change the GOP  and American politics\r\n Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz confront Trump during the February 25 GOP debate\r\nMichael Ciaglo/Pool/Getty Images\r\nTo my surprise, the most compelling conclusion to come out of our polling data wasn't about Trump at all.\r\n\r\nRather, it was that authoritarians, as a growing presence in the GOP, are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump  and will persist as a force in American politics regardless of the fate of his candidacy.\r\n\r\nIf Trump loses the election, that will not remove the threats and social changes that trigger the \"action side\" of authoritarianism. The authoritarians will still be there. They will still look for candidates who will give them the strong, punitive leadership they desire.\r\n\r\nAnd that means Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics, with potentially profound implications for the country.\r\n\r\nIt would also mean more problems for the GOP. This election is already showing that the party establishment abhors Trump and all he stands for  his showy demagoguery, his disregard for core conservative economic values, his divisiveness.\r\n\r\nWe may now have a de facto three-party system: the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians\r\nBut while the party may try to match Trump's authoritarian rhetoric, and its candidates may grudgingly embrace some of his harsher policies toward immigrants or Muslims, in the end a mainstream political party cannot fully commit to extreme authoritarian action the way Trump can.\r\n\r\nThat will be a problem for the party. Just look at where the Tea Party has left the Republican establishment. The Tea Party delivered the House to the GOP in 2010, but ultimately left the party in an unresolved civil war. Tea Party candidates have challenged moderates and centrists, leaving the GOP caucus divided and chaotic.\r\n\r\nNow a similar divide is playing out at the presidential level, with results that are even more destructive for the Republican Party. Authoritarians may be a slight majority within the GOP, and thus able to force their will within the party, but they are too few and their views too unpopular to win a national election on their own.\r\n\r\nAnd so the rise of authoritarianism as a force within American politics means we may now have a de facto three-party system: the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians.\r\n\r\nAnd although the latter two groups are presently forced into an awkward coalition, the GOP establishment has demonstrated a complete inability to regain control over the renegade authoritarians, and the authoritarians are actively opposed to the establishment's centrist goals and uninterested in its economic platform.\r\n\r\nOver time, this will have significant political consequences for the Republican Party. It will become more difficult for Republican candidates to win the presidency because the candidates who can win the nomination by appealing to authoritarian primary voters will struggle to court mainstream voters in the general election. They will have less trouble with local and congressional elections, but that might just mean more legislative gridlock as the GOP caucus struggles to balance the demands of authoritarian and mainstream legislators. The authoritarian base will drag the party further to the right on social issues, and will simultaneously erode support for traditionally conservative economic policies.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meantime, the forces activating American authoritarians seem likely to only grow stronger. Norms around gender, sexuality, and race will continue evolving. Movements like Black Lives Matter will continue chipping away at the country's legacy of institutionalized discrimination, pursuing the kind of social change and reordering of society that authoritarians find so threatening.\r\n\r\nThe chaos in the Middle East, which allows groups like ISIS to flourish and sends millions of refugees spilling into other countries, shows no sign of improving. Longer term, if current demographic trends continue, white Americans will cease to be a majority over the coming decades.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, this could mean a GOP that is even more hard-line on immigration and on policing, that is more outspoken about fearing Muslims and other minority groups, but also takes a softer line on traditional party economic issues like tax cuts. It will be a GOP that continues to perform well in congressional and local elections, but whose divisions leave the party caucus divided to the point of barely functioning, and perhaps eventually unable to win the White House.\r\n\r\nFor decades, the Republican Party has been winning over authoritarians by implicitly promising to stand firm against the tide of social change, and to be the party of force and power rather than the party of negotiation and compromise. But now it may be discovering that its strategy has worked too well  and threatens to tear the party apart.",

    "text": "Like any number of us raised in the late 20th century, I have spent my life perplexed about exactly how Hitler could have come to power in Germany. Watching Donald Trumps rise, I now understand. Leave aside whether a direct comparison of Trump to Hitler is accurate. That is not my point. My point rather is about how a demagogic opportunist can exploit a divided country.\r\n\r\nTo understand the rise of Hitler and the spread of Nazism, I have generally relied on the German-Jewish migr philosopher Hannah Arendt and her arguments about the banality of evil. Somehow people can understand themselves as just doing their job, yet act as cogs in the wheel of a murderous machine. Arendt also offered a second answer in a small but powerful book called Men in Dark Times. In this book, she described all those who thought that Hitlers rise was a terrible thing but chose internal exile, or staying invisible and out of the way as their strategy for coping with the situation. They knew evil was evil, but they too facilitated it, by departing from the battlefield out of a sense of hopelessness.\r\n\r\nOne can see both of these phenomena unfolding now. The first shows itself, for instance, when journalists cover every crude and cruel thing that comes out of Trumps mouth and thereby help acculturate all of us to what we are hearing. Are they not just doing their jobs, they will ask, in covering the Republican front-runner? Have we not already been acculturated by 30 years of popular culture to offensive and inciting comments? Yes, both of these things are true. But that doesnt mean journalists ought to be Trumps megaphone. Perhaps we should just shut the lights out on offensiveness; turn off the mic when someone tries to shout down others; reestablish standards for what counts as a worthwhile contribution to the public debate. That will seem counter to journalistic norms, yes, but why not let Trump pay for his own ads when he wants to broadcast foul and incendiary ideas? Hell still have plenty of access to freedom of expression. It is time to draw a bright line.\r\n\r\nHow Donald Trump won the South Carolina GOP primary, in 60 seconds  Play Video1:01\r\nDonald Trump won the Feb. 20 South Carolina GOP primary. Here's how. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\r\nOne spots the second experience in any number of water-cooler conversations or dinner-party dialogues. Yes, yes, it is terrible. Can you believe it? Have you seen anything like it? Has America come to this? Agreed, agreed. But when someone asks what is to be done, silence falls. Very many of us, too many of us, are starting to contemplate accepting internal exile. Or we joke about moving to Canada more seriously than usually.\r\n\r\nBut over the course of the past few months, Ive learned something else that goes beyond Arendts ideas about the banality of evil and feelings of impotence in the face of danger.\r\n\r\nTrump is rising by taking advantage of a divided country. The truth is that the vast majority of voting Americans think that Trump is unacceptable as a presidential candidate, but we are split by strong partisan ideologies and cannot coordinate a solution to stop him. Similarly, a significant part of voting Republicans think that Trump is unacceptable, but they too, thus far, have been unable to coordinate a solution. Trump is exploiting the fact that we cannot unite across our ideological divides.\r\n\r\nThe only way to stop him, then, is to achieve just that kind of coordination across party lines and across divisions within parties. We have reached that moment of truth.\r\n\r\nRepublicans, you cannot count on the Democrats to stop Trump. I believe that Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination, and I intend to vote for her, but it is also the case that she is a candidate with significant weaknesses, as your party knows quite well. The result of a head-to-head contest between Clinton and Trump would be unpredictable. Trump has to be blocked in your primary.\r\n\r\nJeb Bush has done the right thing by dropping out, just as he did the right thing by being the first, alongside Rand Paul, to challenge Trump. The time has come, John Kasich and Ben Carson, to leave the race as well. You both express a powerful commitment to the good of your country and to its founding ideals. If you care about the future of this republic, it is time to endorse Marco Rubio. Kasich, theres a little wind in your sails, but its not enough. Your country is calling you. Do the right thing.\r\n\r\nTed Cruz is, I believe, pulling votes away from Trump, and for that reason is useful in the race. But, Mr. Cruz, you are drawing too close to Trumps politics. You too should change course.\r\n\r\nDemocrats, your leading candidate is too weak to count on as a firewall. She might be able to pull off a general election victory against Trump, but then again she might not. Too much is uncertain this year. You, too, need to help the Republicans beat Trump; this is no moment for standing by passively. If your deadline for changing your party affiliation has not yet come, re-register and vote for Rubio, even if, like me, you cannot stomach his opposition to marriage equality. I too would prefer Kasich as the Republican nominee, but pursuing that goal will only make it more likely that Trump takes the nomination. The republic cannot afford that.\r\n\r\nFinally, to all of you Republicans who have already dropped out, one more, great act of public service awaits you. As candidates, you pledged to support whomever the Republican party nominated. Its time to revoke your pledge. Be bold, stand up and shout that you will not support Trump if he is your partys nominee. Do it together. Hold one big mother of a news conference. Endorse Rubio, together. It is time to draw a bright line, and you are the ones on whom this burden falls. No one else can do it.\r\n\r\nMarco Rubio, this is also your moment to draw a bright line. You too ought to rescind your pledge to support the partys nominee if it is Trump.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump has no respect for the basic rights that are the foundation of constitutional democracy, nor for the requirements of decency necessary to sustain democratic citizenship. Nor can any democracy survive without an expectation that the people require reasonable arguments that bring the truth to light, and Trump has nothing but contempt for our intelligence.\r\n\r\nWe, the people, need to find somewhere, buried in the recesses of our fading memories, the capacity to make common cause against this formidable threat to our equally shared liberties. The time is now.",

    "text": "Contrary to the conventional wisdom saying that Bernie Sanders would never have been able to force a contested Democratic convention, Hillary Clinton has less than 2,383 pledged delegates. Thus, Bernie Sanders has recently confirmed his desire to continue, as stated by Time:\r\n\r\nBernie Sanders Vows to Continue Political Revolution in New York\r\n\r\nBut that did not stop the Vermont Senator from defiantly promising to continue the political revolution in a town hall on Thursday, giving a glimpse into his possible future role in the Democratic Party in which he campaigns for progressive candidates across the country.\r\n\r\nSpeaking with the cadence and conviction of a viable candidate in midtown Manhattan, Sanders again did not concede the nominationand did not endorse his opponent. \r\nHeres the video of Bernies address from last week and theres also no concession; only a reassurance to millions that his campaign is alive and well.\r\n\r\nTherefore, progressive media and pundits should refrain from their gleeful calls to end Bernies campaign. Vermonts Senator is taking his political revolution to Philadelphia and hell continue to run for the presidency.\r\n\r\nWhy would he stop?\r\n\r\nWould you end your presidential campaign if your opponent faced on ongoing FBI criminal investigation?\r\n\r\nBernie Sanders, his campaign, and millions of supporters throughout the nation and world must wait until July 25th, knowing that the FBI will likely disclose its findings of Clintons email investigation before the Democratic convention. POLITICO confirmed the other day that Clintons email investigation is a criminal investigation, as stated by Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan:\r\n\r\nJudge links Clinton aides immunity to criminal investigation\r\nA former information technology aide to Hillary Clinton received immunity from the Justice Department in connection with a criminal investigation, a federal judge confirmed Tuesday.\r\n\r\nBryan Pagliano, a computer expert who worked at the State Department while Clinton was secretary of state and was also paid privately by her, was previously reported to have received immunity in connection with statements he gave to the FBI about Clintons private server set-up.\r\n\r\nHowever, there had been no explicit confirmation that the investigationwhich Clinton has repeatedly referred to as a security reviewis actually a criminal probe.\r\n\r\nThe privacy interests at stake are high because the governments criminal investigation through which Mr. Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in an order issued Tuesday.\r\nWhen a U.S. District Court Judge confirms your opponent faces a criminal investigation, theres no reason to concede or leave a race for the presidency. Furthermore, Judge Sullivan clearly stated The privacy interests at stake are high because the governments criminal investigation through which Mr. Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential.\r\n\r\nClintons security review days are over, especially since the White House also confirmed the criminal investigation.\r\n\r\nBut theres no chance of Clinton facing legal consequences, right?\r\n\r\nIf you know the answer to this question, then tell the world next years winner of the Super Bowl. Also, explain how Clinton circumvents repercussions from the following NBC article titled Hillary Clinton Emails Held Info Beyond Top Secret:\r\n\r\nEmails from Hillary Clintons home server contained information classified at levels higher than previously known, including a level meant to protect some of the most sensitive U.S. intelligence, according to a document obtained by NBC News.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to lawmakers, the intelligence communitys internal watchdog says some of Clintons emails contained information classified Top Secret/Special Access Program, a secrecy designation that includes some of the most closely held U.S. intelligence matters.\r\n\r\nTwo American intelligence officials tell NBC News these are not the same two emails from Clintons server that have long been reported as containing information deemed Top Secret\r\n\r\nWhile she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, Clinton conducted government business over private email. The arrangement was particularly unusual because the email system relied not on Yahoo or Google but her own server, which she kept in her home in Westchester County, N.Y.\r\nThe act of transferring Special Access Program intelligence from secure government networks onto an unsecure private server correlates directly to the Espionage Act. I explain why Clintons Special Access Program intelligence will lead to a Bernie Sanders presidency in the following YouTube segment.\r\n\r\nFinally, nothing proves both election fraud and a Bernie Sanders presidency better than Clintons treatment of donors. As stated by CNN last week, Secretary of State Clinton put a Chicago commodities trader on an advisory board regarding nuclear strategy:\r\n\r\nWashington (CNN) A major political donor to the Clintons and other top Democrats was selected by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to serve on a key State Department intelligence board in 2011, despite having no clear background in the area, according to emails released this week\r\n\r\nIn July 2011, Fernando was appointed to a seat on the International Security Advisory Board (ISAB), a panel filled with top-level foreign policy advisers and security experts. Former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart chairs the current panel, which includes retired generals, the former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other high-ranking national security experts\r\n\r\nAs a member of the top-level group, Fernando was granted a Top Secret security clearance and given access to highly sensitive information.\r\n\r\nFernando, professional State Department staff noted, seemed an awkward selection for the group and spurred concern when an ABC News reporter inquired about him in 2011\r\n\r\nAn aide, Wade Boese, replied that night that Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills had added Fernandos name to the list of appointees approved by Clinton. The true answer is that S staff (Cheryl Mills) added him. The boards membership preceded me. Raj was not on the list sent to S; he was added at their insistence, Boese wrote. S refers to Clinton, ABC News reported.\r\nNot only did this commodities trader have no background in nuclear strategy, but hes also a Democratic super delegate.\r\n\r\nStill believe the system didnt favor Clinton?\r\n\r\nFrom private servers to advisory boards with donors and super delegates, Clintons candidacy is unique in American history. I recently challenged Nate Cohn and Harry Enten (polling experts who failed to predict the rise of Bernie or Trump) on the data pertaining to presidential candidates and FBI criminal investigations. I asked if they could crunch the numbers, and come up with some kind of analysis on whether or not Clinton will become president, based on prior candidates facing FBI criminal probes.\r\n\r\nSomething tells me that most observers have conveniently ignored the fact Bernies challenger risks serious legal consequences. One can only imagine what pundits would say about Bernie Sanders if he were in Clintons position. Therefore, Bernie has every reason to stay in the race, especially since nobody has ever become nominee alongside an FBI criminal probe.\r\n\r\nWith Bernie Sanders, theres no risk of scandal or FBI investigations. The talk of Bernie leaving the race must stop, especially since Clintons emails will dominate the media very soon. Bernie Sanders just made it official, and after the FBI discloses its findings, expect Bernie Sanders to become Democratic Nominee. The data driven analysis on candidates with ongoing FBI criminal investigations says Bernie Sanders is still the front-runner in 2016.",

    "text": "I dont know about you, but Im getting tired of 2016 presidential election media coverage. Its been a mess since the beginning, when Donald Trump kicked off his campaign with the statement that Mexicans are rapists, and major news channels and newspapers responded by giving him just what he wanted: more coverage than any other candidate.\r\n\r\nFor months I maintained the position that if we all stopped clicking on Donald Trump headlines, he would go away. But no one was interested in that strategy, and now its too late to implement it. The media played a major role in Donald Trumps rise to power, and now it seems as though they are rooting for him to maintain it.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago, a woman filed a federal lawsuit against Donald Trump, alleging that he raped her in 1994, when she was 13 years old. Also named as a defendant in the lawsuit is Jeffrey Epstein, a man who has already served a year in prison for soliciting an underage prostitute, and who was recently described by Donald Trump as a terrific guy.\r\n\r\nThis story was first reported on June 20th by The Real Deal, a publication dedicated to covering New York real estate news. It was picked up by Gothamist, The Daily Beast, Snopes, and a few other websites. I did not learn about the case until a friend of mine shared this Huffington Post blog about it. The case was not covered in Huffington Posts news section, nor in the news section of any major publication.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I received two New York Times push notifications this week with updates about Hillary Clintons emails.\r\n\r\nHas the media decided Donald Trump is just so despicable that it isnt worth covering another atrocity allegedly perpetrated by him, while Hillary Clinton is expected to be a perfect human being, so more coverage of her emails serves the public good? Have they decided Donald Trump is just so immune to negative coverage that reporting this lawsuit is a waste of time, while another story on Hillarys email server is guaranteed to make her even more unpopular?\r\n\r\nOr, is giving credence to rape accusations against powerful men still socially unacceptable? (Re: Peyton Manning)\r\n\r\nIts difficult for me not to think that sexism has a hand in guiding the medias wacky priority list. I know a lot of people are getting tired of accusations of sexism in this presidential race, but sexism would explain why a female candidate sending emails from a private server faces a thousand times more public scrutiny than a male candidate allegedly raping a child.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate what has already been determined about Hillarys emails: Federal law did not prohibit public officials from using private email accounts until 2014, after she left office, and none of her emails were considered classified at the time she sent them via a private server. And yet, Hillary is branded a criminal, while Donald Trumpwho has now had three legal claims of sexual assault filed against himremains the successful businessman whose greatest offense is his ego. \r\n\r\nYou can counter that the claims of sexual assault against Donald Trump are unproven in a court of law, and to that I will counter that Hillary has not been convicted of any crimes either. In this country, the principle of innocent until proven guilty tends to serve the privileged. That principle goes out the window when we discuss accusations against women and people of color.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump may be a megalomaniac who has no experience in public office and has shocked the entire world by making it this far in the race, but the absurdity of his candidacy does not mean that he should be vetted less critically than his opponent. He may be a racist and a misogynist from whom we can never expect anything but the worst, but the reality is that hes one election away from being the most powerful person on the planet. If we dismiss his transgressions as just being typical of his character, we may allow him to actually hold that power in his hands.\r\n\r\nTo all the media gatekeepers out there: If you are frustrated by the fact that criticisms of Donald Trump do not dissuade his supporters in the slightest, I sympathize with you. But your frustration is not an excuse for failing to deliver those criticisms which Trump deserves. Perhaps this latest development would have no effect on Trumps poll numbers, but it still needs to be covered. This is information that the public needs to know.",

    "text": "(CNN)The Democratic National Convention kicked off Monday without its outgoing Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, following a chaotic scene at a morning meeting where she was loudly jeered by Bernie Sanders supporters.\r\n\r\n\"I have decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the convention,\" Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel newspaper in an interview.\r\nBaltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who is also the Democratic National Committee's secretary, handled the gaveling instead.\r\n\"Delegates, alternatives, standing committee members and all of our honored Democrats and other guests here in Philadelphia and all of you who have joined us by television, radio and online, here in the United States and around the world,\" she said, \"I hereby call the 47th quadrennial Democratic National Convention to order.\"\r\nFrom Russia without love? DNC hack roils Philly\r\nWasserman Schultz will also not speak tonight or throughout the duration of the convention, a Democrat close to her says. She will remain in Philadelphia until Friday when she formally steps down as leader of the committee.\r\nWasserman Schultz changed her plans as the fallout deepened from leaked DNC emails that appeared to show the committee favoring presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Sanders during the primary. It became clear Monday that the convention floor could erupt in anger if she gaveled the convention into session or sought to speak.\r\nAnd the Democratic National Committee issued an apology to Sanders moments after the convention opened, likely hoping to help soothe tensions heading into the week.\r\n\"On behalf of everyone at the DNC, we want to offer a deep and sincere apology to Sen. Sanders, his supporters, and the entire Democratic Party for the inexcusable remarks made over email,\" the statement said. \"These comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process. The DNC does not -- and will not -- tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates. Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments, and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again.\"\r\nThe morning Florida delegate meeting descended into chaos when Wasserman Schultz took the stage, with critics holding up signs with the word \"emails,\" and Sanders supporters booing the congresswoman loudly, even after she began speaking.\r\n\"We have to make sure that we move forward together in a unified way,\" Wasserman Schultz said during brief remarks. \"We know that the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive, we know that is not the Florida that we know. The Florida that we know is going to make sure that we continue to make jobs.\"\r\nThe audience was roughly half supportive of Wasserman Schultz and half detractors, though the angry participants were louder than the other half. Those attendees began to chant, \"Shame! Shame! Shame!\" while Wasserman Schultz was speaking.\r\nSanders tried to quell some of his dissatisfied supporters at a rally before his expected speech Monday.\r\n\"We have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine,\" Sanders said, which prompted some attendees to shout him down.\r\nSanders booed after voicing support for Clinton\r\n\r\nSanders booed after voicing support for Clinton 01:18\r\nAlternate plans\r\nWasserman Schultz announced Sunday she is stepping down as chairwoman of the DNC at the end of the party's convention. The drama reinforced concerns about Democratic party unity.\r\nFormer Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver tried to show a unified Democratic Party on Monday, the morning after Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation.\r\n\"This happened, we knew it happened then, now is the time to go forward,' Weaver told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day\" on Monday. \"Now is the time to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump.\"\r\nWasserman Schultz talked with both President Barack Obama and Clinton before making announcing her upcoming resignation, a Democratic source said.\r\n\"Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals [which include electing Clinton president] is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention,\" Wasserman Schultz said in the statement.\r\n\"As party chair, this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats, but for all Americans,\" she said.\r\nSanders campaign manager: We must elect Clinton\r\n\r\nSanders campaign manager: We must elect Clinton 00:56\r\nDNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election. She had been a CNN political commentator, but CNN and Brazile have mutually agreed to suspend their contract, effective immediately, although she will remain on air during the convention week in an unpaid capacity, CNN said. CNN will revisit the contract once Brazile concludes her role.\r\nSeparately, a Democratic operative said Hispanic leaders close to Clinton and her high command were discussing Housing Secretary Julian Castro as a possible successor to Wasserman Schultz at the DNC helm, among a number of other candidates whose name are being mentioned.\r\nChants of \"Debbie is done!\" and \"Debbie resigned!\" broke out at a pro-Sanders rally Sunday in Philadelphia after the news was announced.\r\nParty officials decided Saturday that Wasserman Schultz would not have a major speaking role or preside over daily convention proceedings this week. The DNC Rules Committee has named Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, as permanent chair of the convention, according to a DNC source. She will gavel each session to order and will gavel each session closed.\r\n\"She's been quarantined,\" another top Democrat said of Wasserman Schultz, following a meeting Saturday night but before her announcement that she was leaving.\r\nBoth sides of the aisle react\r\nObama issued a statement, saying, \"For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful.\"\r\nAnd Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the party.\r\n\"I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year's historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week's events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,\" Clinton said.\r\nAfter slamming Wasserman Schultz as \"highly overrated,\" Trump, speaking at a rally in Roanoke, Virginia, knocked Clinton for being disloyal to the soon-to-be former DNC chair.\r\n\"How about that for disloyalty in terms of Hillary Clinton. Because Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary Clinton,\" Trump said. \"These politicians. There's no loyalty there. No loyalty. None whatsoever.\"\r\n\"It gets a little heat and they fire her,\" Trump said. \"Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary and Hillary threw her under a bus and it didn't take more than five minutes to make that decision.\"\r\nWasserman's Republican counterpart, Reince Priebus, said, \"I think the day's events show really the uphill climb Democrats face this week.\"\r\n\"The extreme left will not be satisfied by one person's resignation,\" the Republican party national chairman added.\r\nTrump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz out the door.\r\n\"Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over her failure to secure the DNC's email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign,\" he said in a statement. \"Now Hillary Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz's lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top secret, classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroad.\"\r\nDNC hack: What you need to know\r\nWeaver called Wasserman Schultz's departure a win on CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" on Sunday.\r\n\"I think what the signal was today is that the voices of Bernie Sanders supporters have been heard,\" he said. \"And other people, frankly, in the party, Hillary Clinton supporters, who felt this was the last straw, that she had to go, and this shows they have been heard and gives us opportunity to move forward toward November -- united to deal with the problem of Donald Trump.\"\r\nWasserman Schultz's stewardship of the DNC has been under fire through most of the presidential primary process, but her removal from the convention stage comes following the release of nearly 20,000 emails.\r\nOne email appears to show DNC staffers asking how they can reference Sanders' faith to weaken him in the eyes of Southern voters. Another seems to depict an attorney advising the committee on how to defend Clinton against an accusation by the Sanders campaign of not living up to a joint fundraising agreement.\r\nSanders: No question DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton\r\n\r\nSanders: No question DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton 02:08\r\nBefore the announcement, Sanders on Sunday told Tapper the release of the DNC emails that show its staffers working against him underscores the position he's held for months: Wasserman Schultz needs to go.\r\n\"I don't think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC, not only for these awful emails, which revealed the prejudice of the DNC, but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people, and I don't think her leadership style is doing that,\" Sanders told Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\r\n\"I am not an atheist,\" he said. \"But aside from all of that, it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates -- to be fair and even-minded.\"\r\nHe added: \"But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.\"",

In the video from 2005, published Friday by The Washington Post, you can hear Mr. Bush (first cousin to George W.) wheezing ecstatically as Donald J. Trump brags, inadvertently into a hot mic, about sexually harassing and groping women. The pair, along with a passel of unidentified men, are on a bus en route to film an Access Hollywood segment with the actress Arianne Zucker.\r\n\r\nThrough the window of the bus, Mr. Bush seems to spot Ms. Zucker first, as she waits to greet them. Sheesh, he blurts, breathless, telling Mr. Trump how hot your girl is. You can feel Mr. Bushs giddiness, a contact high, at getting to join a more powerful man in the oldest and most sacred of male bonding exercises: objectifying women.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump spies Ms. Zucker too. Whoa!\r\n\r\nYes! Mr. Bush grunts, Beavis-esque, Yes, the Donald has scored!\r\n\r\nOf course, the Donald has not scored. The Donald is on the NBC lot to shoot a guest appearance on Days of Our Lives at the behest of his employer to promote his reality show, The Apprentice, while Access Hollywood produces an accompanying puff piece. This is work within work within work. Mr. Bush is at work. Mr. Trump is at work. Ms. Zucker is at work, and not only is she not Mr. Trumps girl, she is a complete stranger who is also on camera and being paid to smile.\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nRELATED COVERAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion Nicholas Kristof\r\nDonald Trump, Groper in Chief OCT. 7, 2016\r\n\r\nOpinion Editorial\r\nThe Sleaziness of Donald Trump OCT. 7, 2016\r\n\r\nWhy Republicans Are Probably Stuck With Donald Trump OCT. 8, 2016\r\n\r\nDonald Trump Apology Caps Day of Outrage Over Lewd Tape OCT. 7, 2016\r\nHeh heh heh, Mr. Bush snickers. My man!\r\n\r\nSuch has it always been: powerful men sorting womens bodies into property and trash and good guys, average guys, guys you know, guys you love, guys on the Today show, going along with it. Snickering. Licking a boot here and there, joining in if theyre feeling especially bitter or transgressive or insecure or far from the cameras that day. Perhaps, at their most noble, staying silent. Never speaking up, because the social cost is too high. Its easier to leave that for the victims to bear. After all, theyre used to it.\r\n\r\n \r\n 3:02\r\nDonald Trumps Lewd Comments About Women\r\nVideo\r\nDonald Trumps Lewd Comments About Women\r\nPublish Date October 7, 2016. Photo by Mark Makela for The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \r\nI gotta use some Tic Tacs, Mr. Trump says, still inside the bus, just in case I start kissing her. You know Im automatically attracted to beautiful  I just start kissing them, its like a magnet. Just kiss. I dont even wait. And when youre a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything. Mr. Bush and the bus toadies laugh.\r\n\r\nYou cant do anything, actually. This might be a challenging concept for someone running a campaign so socially retrograde its practically medieval, but women are allowed to own property now. That includes our own bodies, whether you feel automatically entitled to pieces of us or not.\r\n\r\nEvery woman knows a version of Donald Trump. Most of us have known more of them than we can (or care to) recall. Hes the boss who thinks you owe him something; the date who thinks that silence means yes and no means try harder; the stranger who thinks your bodys mere existence constitutes an invitation to touch, take, own and destroy. Hes every deadbeat hookup, every narcissistic loser, every man whos ever tried to leverage power, money, fame, credibility or physical strength to snap your boundaries like matchsticks. He is hot fear and cold dread and a pit in your stomach. Hes the man who held you back, who never took you seriously, who treated you like nothing until you started to believe it, who raped you and told you it was your fault and whose daddy was a cop so who would believe you anyway?\r\n\r\nCome on, women. You know this man. I can name the ones in my past  name yours and imagine each as president, with every womans life in his care. Would you even trust him to watch your dog? (Thats a trick question because he would never do it. His defining characteristic is that he does not care about you.)\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Trump tells Mr. Bush that hes gotta use a Tic Tac just in case he cannot restrain himself from non-consensually affixing his perfectly round, gasping lamprey mouth over Ms. Zuckers, he is talking about sexually assaulting a co-worker.\r\n\r\nWhen he says he grabs womens genitals, he is talking about sexually assaulting anyone he feels like, at any time. Female Trump voters: Its fine if youve come to terms with not being a full human being in the eyes of your party, but what about your daughters? Is that the life you want for them? You want old men to grab their genitals? You want the president of the United States to go around grabbing genitals?\r\n\r\nMr. Trump is rape cultures blathering id, and Sunday night Hillary Clinton (who, no doubt, has just as many man-made scars as the rest of us) has to stand next to him on a stage, and remain unflappable as shes held to an astronomically higher standard, and pretend that he is her equal while his followers persist in howling that sexism is a feminist myth. While Mr. Trump boasts about sexual assault and vows to suppress disobedient media, cable news pundits spend their time taking a protractor to Mrs. Clintons smile  a constant, churning, microanalysis of nothing.\r\n\r\nMany people, well, many men, are expressing their disgust with Mr. Trump the only way they know how: By invoking their mothers and daughters and sisters  people, presumably, with the anatomy Mr. Trump feels free to assess and knead. Hillary Clinton has been showing us all year, and all her life, that, sure, women can be cherished if you want, but they also can be president.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, right-wing lawmakers are scrambling, sanctimonious and pathetic, to distance themselves from their own hideous progeny, clearly hoping to salvage some personal credibility and perhaps even save their party. But here is the thing, the big thing, that Paul D. Ryan and Reince Priebus and Mike Pence and all the spineless Billy Bushes of the world (and plenty of progressive men too, for that matter) dont understand: Most of you are no better than Mr. Trump; you are just more subtle.\r\n\r\nIf you have spent your career brutalizing and dehumanizing women legislatively rather than personally, you are no better. If you were happy to overlook months of violent racism, xenophobia, transphobia and Islamophobia from the Trump campaign, but now youre mad that he used a bad word and tried to sleep with another mans wife, you are no better. If you have derided and stigmatized identity politics in an effort to keep the marginalized from organizing, you are no better. If you snicker or say nothing while your fellow men behave like Donald Trump, you are no better.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that all of you have failed women for generations, and you deserve to lose our votes. Next month we will grab you where it hurts. By your ballots.",

    "text": "Conservatives efforts to recruit a candidate to compete against Donald Trump may have only been able to come up with David French, a National Review writer, who is merely contemplating the possibility of running. But last week, a new potential candidate stepped up to the stage, if not for this race, possibly for a future one. Dwayne Johnson, the actor formerly known by his professional wrestling moniker The Rock, told British GQ that hes considered a different kind of career.\r\n\r\nIll be honest, I havent ruled politics out. Im not being coy when I say that, but at the moment I am not sure, Johnson said. I cant deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring. And beyond that, it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on peoples lives on a global scale. But there are a lot of other things I want to do first.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of yet another former reality-television star running for higher office may feel improbable at best and horrifying at worst, given Trumps performance in the 2016 campaign thus far. And I cant vouch for Johnsons position on the issues  though hes registered as a Republican and has appeared at the Republican convention to boost voter registration,* hes generally talked less about actual policy and spent more time flashing his famously winning smile:\r\n\r\n\r\nBut just as I was an early champion of Johnsons acting abilities  hes fascinating as a gay, closeted driver in Be Cool, mesmerizing as a an amnesiac who is not doing well in the post-apocalypse in Southland Tales and one of the funniest parts of Michael Bays wildly underrated Pain & Gain  Ive long thought that Johnson had a weirdly plausible path to a political career.\r\n\r\nHe grew up all around the country because of his fathers job but makes his home in Florida, an important state in presidential election years and the place where he played football for the University of Miami. (The locker room was named for him after he made a major donation). Since his pivot to movie stardom, Johnson has become one of the most consistently likable celebrities in America, as measured by the Q Scores Company; hed begin any race not just with high name recognition, but also with high favorable ratings. Johnson is even descended from James Bowles, a free black man who fought with the British during the Revolutionary War when the kingdom offered land and freedom to black Americans who joined their side. (His mothers side of the family is Samoan.)\r\n\r\nFor a Republican Party that was desperate to woo nonwhite voters before Donald Trump tossed his toupee in the ring, and will be even harder-pressed to woo them once our present mess is over, Johnson could be the sort of person the GOP tries to renovate into a viable candidate.\r\n\r\nIf he doesnt have policy or issue bona fides, Johnsons relative silence on substance also means he doesnt have a record that can be used to tar him as some sort of flip-flopper. And he could also make a series of carefully selected charitable and political donations designed to start building a record of positions. Its easier to teach talking points than charisma, as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) experienced earlier this year.\r\n\r\nOf course, if he really was going to try to follow Ronald Reagans path to the presidency, Johnson would certainly have to run for something else first. And he could do it as early as this year: Johnson has until June 24 to get on the primary ballot in Florida and join the candidates who are competing for the Senate seat Marco Rubio decided to vacate when he ran for president.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of The Rock sitting through committee hearings might be vaguely ridiculous, and a governorship would probably require him to take fewer potentially damaging votes. But the lesson of this year in American politics is that stranger things can always happen. And Trump is proof that if our politics are turning into reality-television competitions, the results could always be worse.",

    "text": "We live in a big, diverse society. There are essentially two ways to maintain order and get things done in such a society  politics or some form of dictatorship. Either through compromise or brute force. Our founding fathers chose politics.\r\n\r\nPolitics is an activity in which you recognize the simultaneous existence of different groups, interests and opinions. You try to find some way to balance or reconcile or compromise those interests, or at least a majority of them. You follow a set of rules, enshrined in a constitution or in custom, to help you reach these compromises in a way everybody considers legitimate.\r\n\r\nThe downside of politics is that people never really get everything they want. Its messy, limited and no issue is ever really settled. Politics is a muddled activity in which people have to recognize restraints and settle for less than they want. Disappointment is normal.\r\n\r\nBut thats sort of the beauty of politics, too. It involves an endless conversation in which we learn about other people and see things from their vantage point and try to balance their needs against our own. Plus, its better than the alternative: rule by some authoritarian tyrant who tries to govern by clobbering everyone in his way.\r\n\r\nAs Bernard Crick wrote in his book, In Defence of Politics, Politics is a way of ruling divided societies without undue violence.\r\n\r\nOver the past generation we have seen the rise of a group of people who are against politics. These groups  best exemplified by the Tea Party but not exclusive to the right  want to elect people who have no political experience. They want outsiders. They delegitimize compromise and deal-making. Theyre willing to trample the customs and rules that give legitimacy to legislative decision-making if it helps them gain power.\r\n\r\nUltimately, they dont recognize other people. They suffer from a form of political narcissism, in which they dont accept the legitimacy of other interests and opinions. They dont recognize restraints. They want total victories for themselves and their doctrine.\r\n\r\nThis antipolitics tendency has had a wretched effect on our democracy. It has led to a series of overlapping downward spirals:\r\n\r\nThe antipolitics people elect legislators who have no political skills or experience. That incompetence leads to dysfunctional government, which leads to more disgust with government, which leads to a demand for even more outsiders.\r\n\r\nThe antipolitics people dont accept that politics is a limited activity. They make soaring promises and raise ridiculous expectations. When those expectations are not met, voters grow cynical and, disgusted, turn even further in the direction of antipolitics.\r\n\r\nThe antipolitics people refuse compromise and so block the legislative process. The absence of accomplishment destroys public trust. The decline in trust makes deal-making harder.\r\n\r\nWere now at a point where the Senate says it wont even hold hearings on a presidential Supreme Court nominee, in clear defiance of custom and the Constitution. Were now at a point in which politicians live in fear if they try to compromise and legislate. Were now at a point in which normal political conversation has broken down. People feel unheard, which makes them shout even louder, which further destroys conversation.\r\n\r\nAnd in walks Donald Trump. People say that Trump is an unconventional candidate and that he represents a break from politics as usual. Thats not true. Trump is the culmination of the trends we have been seeing for the last 30 years: the desire for outsiders; the bashing style of rhetoric that makes conversation impossible; the decline of coherent political parties; the declining importance of policy; the tendency to fight cultural battles and identity wars through political means.\r\n\r\nTrump represents the path the founders rejected. There is a hint of violence undergirding his campaign. There is always a whiff, and sometimes more than a whiff, of Id like to punch him in the face.\r\n\r\nI printed out a Times list of the insults Trump has hurled on Twitter. The list took up 33 pages. Trumps style is bashing and pummeling. Everyone who opposes or disagrees with him is an idiot, a moron or a loser. The implied promise of his campaign is that he will come to Washington and bully his way through.\r\n\r\nTrumps supporters arent looking for a political process to address their needs. They are looking for a superhero. As the political scientist Matthew MacWilliams found, the one trait that best predicts whether youre a Trump supporter is how high you score on tests that measure authoritarianism.\r\n\r\nThis isnt just an American phenomenon. Politics is in retreat and authoritarianism is on the rise worldwide. The answer to Trump is politics. Its acknowledging other people exist. Its taking pleasure in that difference and hammering out workable arrangements. As Harold Laski put it, We shall make the basis of our state consent to disagreement. Therein shall we ensure its deepest harmony.",

    "text": "The presidential candidates have wildly varying tax proposals.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump and Ted Cruz propose massive cuts that would greatly reduce federal income taxes on everyone, especially the wealthy, while cutting a wide host of government programs. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders proposes virtually the opposite: tax increases on everyone, with hikes on the wealthy especially, while adding comprehensive government programs. And Hillary Clinton proposes much smaller tax increases, all focused on the rich.\r\n\r\nBut what do their plans mean for your federal tax liability?\r\n\r\nWe partnered with the Tax Policy Center to create a calculator that will estimate how each presidential candidate's tax plan would affect you  or, more accurately, people like you. For example, if you are part of a couple with two children earning $38,000 a year, this calculator tells you the average change in federal taxes for all couples with two children who earn between $35,000 and $40,000 a year.\r\n\r\nBefore you change your vacation plans based on these numbers, keep in mind they are only estimates. Every taxpayer has a slightly different situation  someone might be deducting business expenses, for example, while another person will be paying a tax for not carrying insurance coverage. This creates millions of different scenarios.\r\n\r\nAccounting for all of that is prohibitively complicated and time-consuming. But what we have done is simplify the process to consider only the biggest factors (income, marital status, and children) and only look at the four taxes with the largest impact (individual and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and excise taxes).\r\n\r\nTry it yourself below.\r\n\r\n(Note: The Tax Policy Center did not perform an analysis of John Kasich's tax plan because his plan lacks sufficient detail to model. They have reached out to the Kasich campaign in search of more details, and will analyze the plan if they receive enough information to do so.)\r\n\r\nThe calculator: How much does each candidate's tax plan affect you?\r\n\r\nRead this: Ezra wrote a piece about what the tax calculator tells us about the candidates. On Cruz and Trump, he writes:\r\n\r\nIn a sense, both GOP candidates are gaming the calculator: They've proposed tremendous cuts, but without knowing who will pay for those cuts, it's hard to know who will truly be helped and who will be badly hurt.\r\nOn Sanders, he writes:\r\n\r\nSanders, meanwhile, proposes to raise taxes by more than Trump proposes to cut them. But it's wrong, I think, to view Sanders's plan as primarily a change to America's tax code. The huge tax increases are a byproduct of Sanders's plans to nationalize major sectors of American life.\r\nRead the full analysis here.\r\n\r\nUpdate on why rates are higher than you think: We've been getting a lot of questions about why your current effective tax rate is so high. Here's a note from Tax Policy Center director Len Burman that explains why this is happening:\r\n\r\nYou might be surprised at how much taxes youre paying under current law. Were including payroll taxes, excise taxes, and corporate income taxes as well as individual income taxes. Most working people actually pay more in payroll tax than income tax. And they pay much more if you include the employers portion of the tax. Most economists think employers pass their share of the tax on to workers in the form of lower wages.\r\nUpdate, plus a FAQ section: To calculate the tax rate, we originally used adjusted gross income (AGI), but we decided to switch over to expanded cash income (ECI), because this measure includes income that is not subject to income tax, like health insurance premiums paid by employers. This allows the calculator to provide a more accurate view of your tax rate. For a longer explanation, read this Q&A.\r\n\r\nWhat we learned from our calculator\r\nPlay around with different incomes other than your own to get a better idea of how each candidate deals with the poor, middle class, and wealthy.\r\n\r\nIn short, what you'll see is:\r\n\r\nClinton proposes keeping things mostly the same.\r\nSanders wants to implement massive increases across the board, including on the poor.\r\nCruz and Trump propose big cuts for everyone  but the wealthier you are, the more you keep in your pocket.\r\nBut how does this affect how much money the federal government brings in?\r\nIt's one thing to know how your taxes will change, but you can't view it in a vacuum. What the federal government does can affect your bottom line, too.\r\n\r\nFor example, Bernie Sanders's plan would raise taxes on everyone, but it would also pay for health care, education, and other programs that you would no longer have to pay for. And it goes the other way, too. If Donald Trump's tax plan was implemented, everyone would get a tax cut, but it also means government services would be cut, so you would have to pay for them yourself.\r\n\r\nSo this is how each candidate deals with this balance:\r\n\r\nDonald Trump: His plan would cut federal revenues by an estimated $9.5 trillion over the next decade. Cuts would be across the board, but most cuts would be for wealthier households. His tax cuts promise to stimulate economic growth and reduce government spending, which could cause households to pay more for services that are currently subsidized by the government. (Here are more details on Trump's plan.)\r\n\r\nTed Cruz: His plan would cut federal revenues by an estimated $8.6 trillion over the next decade. Much like Trump's plan, cuts would be across the board, but most cuts are for wealthier households. His tax cuts promise to stimulate economic growth and reduce government spending, which could cause households to pay more for services that are currently subsidized by the government. (Here are more details on Cruz's plan.)\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton: Her plan would raise federal revenues by an additional $1.1 trillion over the next decade. Most increases would be for wealthier households, while lower-income households aren't affected much. The additional revenues will pay for programs that benefit many Americans. (Here are more details on Clinton's plan.)\r\n\r\nBernie Sanders: His plan would raise federal revenues by an estimated $15.3 trillion over the next decade. He would raise taxes for almost all households, but most increases would be for wealthier households; tax increases would be small for lower- and middle-income households. Additional revenues would pay for health care, education, and other programs, so households would pay less than what they currently pay for those services. (Here are more details on Sanders's plan.)",

    "text": "It came together in about a week. First, the idea for a punchy, uplifting dance video that would tell a story about diversity, difference and communal support. Then, 170 dancers, a few hours of rehearsalsand pantsuits. Lots of pantsuits.\r\n\r\nThe result: the #Pantsuitpower Flashmob for Hillary dance video, performed at New Yorks Union Square. Its gotten nearly 2 million views on Facebook in a matter of days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe video, accompanied by Justin Timberlakes contagiously boppy disco-pop song Cant Stop the Feeling, was posted on Facebook and Vimeo this week by Humanity for Hillary, a social media campaign aimed at artists, in support of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nI wanted to bring some kind of humanity to her campaign, because I think humanity and love and humor tend to get lost when were in the heat of all of this, says Celia Rowlson-Hall, 32, a New York-based choreographer whos worked on HBOs Girls and other TV shows and music videos. She and her Washington, D.C.-based friend, hiphop choreographer Crishon Landers, created the pantsuit dance, and Rowlson-Hall directed the video with her partner, Mia Lidofsky, an independent film producer. The couple met on the set of Girls.\r\n\r\nWe just felt the need to do something, Rowlson-Hall says. We thought, how can we creatively impact this election? So we made the video.\r\n\r\nTheres nothing like dance to convey enthusiasm and energy, so its a natural political tool. The fact that its rarely used to rally votersand even more rarely used so wellis what makes this video feel so fresh. That, and the clarity of the choreography, the invigorating spirit and skill of the videos massive chorus line, and the catchy tune.\r\n\r\n[In a departure from negative TV ads, Clinton airs a spot featuring home videos of children.]\r\n\r\nA graduate of North Carolina School of the Arts, Rowlson-Hall has worked in the New York dance scene for the past decade, first performing with a couple of troupes, and more recently choreographing for stage, film and television. She made her feature-film directorial debut with Ma, writing the wordless script, choreographing it and starring in it; it became a favorite of the 2015 American Film Institute Festival. She and Landers choreographed the flashmob scene in about four hours, she says, using simple, clear moves drawn from hiphop, ballet and modern dance. Each bears a message: Raised fists signify #BlackLivesMatter, arms and faces tilted to the sky hint at solar energy, circling hips symbolize reproductive rights. In the quietest and most emotional moment, dancers take a knee to evoke San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernicks national anthem protest against police brutality. Others stand with a hand on their hearts.\r\n\r\nThis is our right as a democracy to protest or honor the flag as we see fit, says Rowlson-Hall. \r\n\r\nShe put the word out on Instagram and Facebook seeking dancers. She videotaped herself dancing the steps, and texted it to the dancers whod replied. Many are professionals. A few came from Broadways Fiddler on the Roof and the Martha Graham Dance Company. Some came from as far away as Toronto. Assorted dance enthusiasts joined indentists, other artists and little girls fresh from soccer practice. They had a couple days to learn the moves on their own, then they met in small groups for one-hour sessions with the choreographers. Thats when they were also fitted for their pantsuits, an homage to Clintons go-to workwear. A few suits were donated by Topshop. Stylists scoured thrift stores for the rest.\r\n\r\n[The funniest lines from Hillary Clintons interview on Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis]\r\n\r\nNear the end you can glimpse the slender, short-haired Rowlson-Hall grooving in a pinstriped suit, her T-shirt emblazoned with The Future is Female.\r\n\r\nFor all the ebullient energy of the dancing, the video also produced some headaches. The directors didnt have a permit to use Union Square for their shoot.\r\n\r\nThe power behind the 'power blazer'  Play Video3:26\r\nDesigner Nina McLemore knows how to dress with attitude, which is why presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of the nations most powerful women look to her for fashion advice. (Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)\r\n\r\nWe were terrified wed get shut down by the cops, says Lidofsky. They also feared pushback from Timberlake. They reached out to his manager about using his song, Lidofsky adds, but with no reply they plowed ahead, hoping Timberlake wouldnt mind. (No word from him yet.)\r\n\r\nThe only time the whole group rehearsed together was 20 minutes before the taping last Sunday morning, Oct 2.\r\n\r\nThe dancers came knowing the choreography to a T. Ive never seen dancers work like that, says Rowlson-Hall. It was a whirlwind.\r\n\r\nClinton has some appreciation for dance: Her daughter, Chelsea, was a Washington School of Ballet student during Bill Clintons presidency. So far, however, Hillary Clinton has been silent about the pantsuit dance.\r\n\r\nBut were refreshing our email every single minute, Lidofsky says with a laugh. We really hope she saw this, and felt the love.",

    "text": "On Monday, Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he merrily repeated a woman in the crowd who called Ted Cruz a pussy. Twenty-four hours later, Donald Trump won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide.\r\n\r\nI'm not here to clutch my pearls over Trump's vulgarity; what was telling, rather, was the immaturity of the moment, the glee Trump took in his \"she said it, I didn't\" game. The media, which has grown used to covering Trump as a sideshow, delighted in the moment along with him  it was funny, and it meant clicks, takes, traffic. But it was more than that. It was the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president showing off the demagogue's instinct for amplifying the angriest voice in the mob.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniably enjoyable to watch Trump. He's red-faced, discursive, funny, angry, strange, unpredictable, and real. He speaks without filter and tweets with reckless abandon. The Donald Trump phenomenon is a riotous union of candidate ego and voter id. America's most skilled political entertainer is putting on the greatest show we've ever seen.\r\n\r\nIt's so fun to watch that it's easy to lose sight of how terrifying it really is.\r\n\r\nTrump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory. He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament; he's a racist, a sexist, and a demagogue, but he's also a narcissist, a bully, and a dilettante. He lies so constantly and so fluently that it's hard to know if he even realizes he's lying. He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump Campaigns Across New Hampshire Ahead Of Primary Day\r\nPhoto by Joe Raedle/Getty Images\r\nTrump is in serious contention to win the Republican presidential nomination. His triumph in a general election is unlikely, but it is far from impossible. He's not a joke and he's not a clown. He's a man who could soon be making decisions of war and peace, who would decide which regulations are enforced and which are lifted, who would be responsible for nominating Supreme Court justices and representing America in the community of nations. This is not political entertainment. This is politics.\r\n\r\nTrump's path to power has been unnerving. His business is licensing out his own name as a symbol of opulence. He has endured bankruptcies and scandal by bragging his way out of them. He rose to prominence in the Republican Party as a leader of the birther movement. He climbed to the top of the polls in this election by calling Mexicans rapists and killers. He defended a poor debate performance by accusing Megyn Kelly of being on her period. He responded to rival Ted Cruz's surge by calling for a travel ban on Muslims. When two of his supporters attacked a homeless man and said they did it because \"Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,\" he brushed off complaints that he's inspiring violence by saying his supporters are \"very passionate.\"\r\n\r\nBehind Trump's success is an unerring instinct for harnessing anger, resentment, and fear. His view of the economy is entirely zero-sum  for Americans to win, others must lose. \"We're going to make America great again,\" he said in his New Hampshire victory speech, \"but we're going to do it the old-fashioned way. We're going to beat China, Japan, beat Mexico at trade. We're going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis. It's not going to happen anymore.\"\r\n\r\nTrump answers America's rage with more rage. As the journalist Molly Ball observed, \"All the other candidates say 'Americans are angry, and I understand.' Trump says, 'IM angry.'\" Trump doesn't offer solutions so much as he offers villains. His message isn't so much that he'll help you as he'll hurt them.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump Holds New Hampshire Primary Night Gathering In Manchester\r\nPhoto by Joe Raedle/Getty Images\r\nTrump's other gift  the one that gets less attention but is perhaps more important  is his complete lack of shame. It's easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they're exposed as liars, when they're seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested.\r\n\r\nTrump doesn't. He has the reality television star's ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won't, to say what others can't, to do what others wouldn't.\r\n\r\nTrump lives by the reality television trope that he's not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they're not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. \"I'm not here to make friends\" is another way of saying, \"I'm not bound by the social conventions of normal people.\" The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind.\r\n\r\nThis, more than his ideology, is why Trump genuinely scares me. There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field. He seems more dovish than neoconservatives like Marco Rubio, and less dismissive of the social safety net than libertarians like Rand Paul. But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump; his temperament is so immature, his narcissism so clear, his political base so unique, his reactions so strange, that I honestly have no idea what he would do  or what he wouldn't do.\r\n\r\nWhen MSNBC's Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin, who \"kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries,\" Trump replied, \"He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country.\" Later, he clarified that he doesn't actually condone killing journalists, but, he warned the crowd, \"I do hate them.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a lie that if you put a frog into a pot of water and slowly turn up the heat the frog will simply boil, but it's a fact that if you put the American political system in a room with Trump for long enough we slowly lose track of how noxious he is, or we at least run out of ways to keep repeating it.\r\n\r\nBut tonight is a night to repeat it. There is something scary in Donald Trump. We should fear his rise.",

    "text": "During a 33-year career at the Central Intelligence Agency, I served presidents of both parties  three Republicans and three Democrats. I was at President George W. Bushs side when we were attacked on Sept. 11; as deputy director of the agency, I was with President Obama when we killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.\r\n\r\nI am neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican. In my 40 years of voting, I have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties. As a government official, I have always been silent about my preference for president.\r\n\r\nNo longer. On Nov. 8, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. Between now and then, I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president.\r\n\r\nTwo strongly held beliefs have brought me to this decision. First, Mrs. Clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief. I trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president  keeping our nation safe. Second, Donald J. Trump is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security.\r\n\r\nI spent four years working with Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state, most often in the White House Situation Room. In these critically important meetings, I found her to be prepared, detail-oriented, thoughtful, inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argument.\r\n\r\nI also saw the secretarys commitment to our nations security; her belief that America is an exceptional nation that must lead in the world for the country to remain secure and prosperous; her understanding that diplomacy can be effective only if the country is perceived as willing and able to use force if necessary; and, most important, her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all  whether to put young American women and men in harms way.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clinton was an early advocate of the raid that brought Bin Laden to justice, in opposition to some of her most important colleagues on the National Security Council. During the early debates about how we should respond to the Syrian civil war, she was a strong proponent of a more aggressive approach, one that might have prevented the Islamic State from gaining a foothold in Syria.\r\n\r\nI never saw her bring politics into the Situation Room. In fact, I saw the opposite. When some wanted to delay the Bin Laden raid by one day because the White House Correspondents Dinner might be disrupted, she said, Screw the White House Correspondents Dinner.\r\n\r\nIn sharp contrast to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump has no experience on national security. Even more important, the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief.\r\n\r\nThese traits include his obvious need for self-aggrandizement, his overreaction to perceived slights, his tendency to make decisions based on intuition, his refusal to change his views based on new information, his routine carelessness with the facts, his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of law.\r\n\r\nThe dangers that flow from Mr. Trumps character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president. It is already damaging our national security.\r\n\r\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a career intelligence officer, trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them. That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trumps vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated.\r\n\r\nMr. Putin is a great leader, Mr. Trump says, ignoring that he has killed and jailed journalists and political opponents, has invaded two of his neighbors and is driving his economy to ruin. Mr. Trump has also taken policy positions consistent with Russian, not American, interests  endorsing Russian espionage against the United States, supporting Russias annexation of Crimea and giving a green light to a possible Russian invasion of the Baltic States.\r\n\r\nIn the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump has also undermined security with his call for barring Muslims from entering the country. This position, which so clearly contradicts the foundational values of our nation, plays into the hands of the jihadist narrative that our fight against terrorism is a war between religions.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many Muslim Americans play critical roles in protecting our country, including the man, whom I cannot identify, who ran the C.I.A.s Counterterrorism Center for nearly a decade and who I believe is most responsible for keeping America safe since the Sept. 11 attacks.\r\n\r\nMy training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it. This is what I did for the C.I.A. This is what I am doing now. Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president.",

The Wayne, Michigan, plant that now builds the Focus and C-Max that will move to Mexico will instead start building other models -- probably the new Ford Bronco SUV and Ranger small pickup.\r\n\"Ford has been in the United States for more than 100 years. Our home is here. We will be here forever,\" said spokeswoman Christine Baker.\r\nThe company has 85,000 U.S. employees, up 28,000, or nearly 50%, in just the last five years. It has 8,800 employees at Mexican plants, and will add 2,800 jobs there when the new $1.6 billion plant opens there in 2018.\r\nFord committed to build new vehicles at the Michigan Assembly Plant to take the place of the Focus and C-Max when it reached a new contract late last year with the United Auto Workers union, which represents 3,900 hourly workers at the plant.\r\nAnd while Ford is shifting production of all small cars to Mexico, it will continue to make many car models at U.S. plants, including the iconic Mustang.\r\nRelated: Ford moving all small car production to Mexico\r\nThe small cars Ford is shifting to Mexico are less popular and less profitable models.\r\nTrump has been using Ford for months as a prime example of what's wrong with U.S. trade policy, but Ford has been strongly rebutting the GOP nominee.\r\nThe issue surfaced again on Wednesday when a Ford executive, speaking at a conference for investors, reiterated the company's plans to move its small car production to Mexico.\r\nRelated: 'President Trump' would cost U.S. economy $1 trillion\r\nDuring a Fox News interview, Trump vowed to impose a 35% tax on cars built in Mexico if they're shipped back to the U.S.\r\n\"They think they're going to get away with this and they fire all their employees in the United States and...move to Mexico,\" said Trump. \"When that car comes back across the border into our country that now comes in free, we're gonna charge them a 35% tax.

    "text": "Let us now address the greatest American mystery at the moment: what motivates the supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump?\r\n\r\nI call it a mystery because the working-class white people who make up the bulk of Trumps fan base show up in amazing numbers for the candidate, filling stadiums and airport hangars, but their views, by and large, do not appear in our prestige newspapers. On their opinion pages, these publications take care to represent demographic categories of nearly every kind, but blue-collar is one they persistently overlook. The views of working-class people are so foreign to that universe that when New York Times columnist Nick Kristof wanted to engage a Trump supporter last week, he made one up, along with this imaginary persons responses to his questions.\r\n\r\nWhen members of the professional class wish to understand the working-class Other, they traditionally consult experts on the subject. And when these authorities are asked to explain the Trump movement, they always seem to zero in on one main accusation: bigotry. Only racism, they tell us, is capable of powering a movement like Trumps, which is blowing through the inherited structure of the Republican party like a tornado through a cluster of McMansions.\r\n\r\nTrump himself provides rather excellent evidence for this finding. The man is an insult clown who has systematically gone down the list of American ethnic groups and offended them each in turn. He wants to deport millions upon millions of undocumented immigrants. He wants to bar Muslims from visiting the United States. He admires various foreign strongmen and dictators, and has even retweeted a quote from Mussolini. This gold-plated buffoon has in turn drawn the enthusiastic endorsement of leading racists from across the spectrum of intolerance, a gorgeous mosaic of haters, each of them quivering excitedly at the prospect of getting a real, honest-to-god bigot in the White House.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this stuff is so insane, so wildly outrageous, that the commentariat has deemed it to be the entirety of the Trump campaign. Trump appears to be a racist, so racism must be what motivates his armies of followers. And so, on Saturday, New York Times columnist Timothy Egan blamed none other than the people for Trumps racism: Donald Trumps supporters know exactly what he stands for: hatred of immigrants, racial superiority, a sneering disregard of the basic civility that binds a society.\r\n\r\nStories marveling at the stupidity of Trump voters are published nearly every day. Articles that accuse Trumps followers of being bigots have appeared by the hundreds, if not the thousands. Conservatives have written them; liberals have written them; impartial professionals have written them. The headline of a recent Huffington Post column announced, bluntly, that Trump Won Super Tuesday Because America is Racist. A New York Times reporter proved that Trumps followers were bigots by coordinating a map of Trump support with a map of racist Google searches. Everyone knows it: Trumps followers passions are nothing more than the ignorant blurtings of the white American id, driven to madness by the presence of a black man in the White House. The Trump movement is a one-note phenomenon, a vast surge of race-hate. Its partisans are not only incomprehensible, they are not really worth comprehending.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\nOr so were told. Last week, I decided to watch several hours of Trump speeches for myself. I saw the man ramble and boast and threaten and even seem to gloat when protesters were ejected from the arenas in which he spoke. I was disgusted by these things, as I have been disgusted by Trump for 20 years. But I also noticed something surprising. In each of the speeches I watched, Trump spent a good part of his time talking about an entirely legitimate issue, one that could even be called leftwing.\r\n\r\nYes, Donald Trump talked about trade. In fact, to judge by how much time he spent talking about it, trade may be his single biggest concern  not white supremacy. Not even his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, the issue that first won him political fame. He did it again during the debate on 3 March: asked about his political excommunication by Mitt Romney, he chose to pivot and talk about  trade.\r\n\r\nIt seems to obsess him: the destructive free-trade deals our leaders have made, the many companies that have moved their production facilities to other lands, the phone calls he will make to those companies CEOs in order to threaten them with steep tariffs unless they move back to the US.\r\n\r\nTrump embellished this vision with another favorite leftwing idea: under his leadership, the government would start competitive bidding in the drug industry. (We dont competitively bid! he marveled  another true fact, a legendary boondoggle brought to you by the George W Bush administration.) Trump extended the critique to the military-industrial complex, describing how the government is forced to buy lousy but expensive airplanes thanks to the power of industry lobbyists.\r\n\r\nThus did he hint at his curious selling proposition: because he is personally so wealthy, a fact about which he loves to boast, Trump himself is unaffected by business lobbyists and donations. And because he is free from the corrupting power of modern campaign finance, famous deal-maker Trump can make deals on our behalf that are good instead of bad. The chance that he will actually do so, of course, is small. He appears to be a hypocrite on this issue as well as so many other things. But at least Trump is saying this stuff.\r\n\r\nAll this surprised me because, for all the articles about Trump I had read in recent months, I didnt recall trade coming up very often. Trump is supposed to be on a one-note crusade for whiteness. Could it be that all this trade stuff is a key to understanding the Trump phenomenon?\r\n\r\n* * *\r\nTrade is an issue that polarizes Americans by socio-economic status. To the professional class, which encompasses the vast majority of our media figures, economists, Washington officials and Democratic powerbrokers, what they call free trade is something so obviously good and noble it doesnt require explanation or inquiry or even thought. Republican and Democratic leaders alike agree on this, and no amount of facts can move them from their Econ 101 dream.\r\n\r\nTo the remaining 80 or 90% of America, trade means something very different. Theres a video going around on the internet these days that shows a room full of workers at a Carrier air conditioning plant in Indiana being told by an officer of the company that the factory is being moved to Monterrey, Mexico, and that theyre all going to lose their jobs.\r\n\r\nAs I watched it, I thought of all the arguments over trade that weve had in this country since the early 1990s, all the sweet words from our economists about the scientifically proven benevolence of free trade, all the ways in which our newspapers mock people who say that treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement allow companies to move jobs to Mexico.\r\n\r\nWell, here is a video of a company moving its jobs to Mexico, courtesy of Nafta. This is what it looks like. The Carrier executive talks in that familiar and highly professional HR language about the need to stay competitive and the extremely price-sensitive marketplace. A worker shouts Fuck you! at the executive. The executive asks people to please be quiet so he can share his information. His information about all of them losing their jobs.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\nNow, I have no special reason to doubt the suspicion that Donald Trump is a racist. Either he is one, or (as the comedian John Oliver puts it) he is pretending to be one, which amounts to the same thing.\r\n\r\nBut there is another way to interpret the Trump phenomenon. A map of his support may coordinate with racist Google searches, but it coordinates even better with deindustrialization and despair, with the zones of economic misery that 30 years of Washingtons free-market consensus have brought the rest of America.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that Trump is making a point of assailing that Indiana air conditioning company from the video in his speeches. What this suggests is that hes telling a tale as much about economic outrage as it is tale of racism on the march. Many of Trumps followers are bigots, no doubt, but many more are probably excited by the prospect of a president who seems to mean it when he denounces our trade agreements and promises to bring the hammer down on the CEO that fired you and wrecked your town, unlike Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nHere is the most salient supporting fact: when people talk to white, working-class Trump supporters, instead of simply imagining what they might say, they find that what most concerns these people is the economy and their place in it. I am referring to a study just published by Working America, a political-action auxiliary of the AFL-CIO, which interviewed some 1,600 white working-class voters in the suburbs of Cleveland and Pittsburgh in December and January.\r\n\r\nSupport for Donald Trump, the group found, ran strong among these people, even among self-identified Democrats, but not because they are all pining for a racist in the White House. Their favorite aspect of Trump was his attitude, the blunt and forthright way he talks. As far as issues are concerned, immigration placed third among the matters such voters care about, far behind their number one concern: good jobs / the economy.\r\n\r\nPeople are much more frightened than they are bigoted, is how the findings were described to me by Karen Nussbaum, the executive director of Working America. The survey confirmed what we heard all the time: people are fed up, people are hurting, they are very distressed about the fact that their kids dont have a future and that there still hasnt been a recovery from the recession, that every family still suffers from it in one way or another.\r\n\r\nTom Lewandowski, the president of the Northeast Indiana Central Labor Council in Fort Wayne, puts it even more bluntly when I asked him about working-class Trump fans. These people arent racist, not any more than anybody else is, he says of Trump supporters he knows. When Trump talks about trade, we think about the Clinton administration, first with Nafta and then with [Permanent Normal Trade Relations] China, and here in Northeast Indiana, we hemorrhaged jobs.\r\n\r\nThey look at that, and heres Trump talking about trade, in a ham-handed way, but at least hes representing emotionally. Weve had all the political establishment standing behind every trade deal, and we endorsed some of these people, and then weve had to fight them to get them to represent us.\r\n\r\nNow, let us stop and smell the perversity. Left parties the world over were founded to advance the fortunes of working people. But our left party in America  one of our two monopoly parties  chose long ago to turn its back on these peoples concerns, making itself instead into the tribune of the enlightened professional class, a creative class that makes innovative things like derivative securities and smartphone apps. The working people that the party used to care about, Democrats figured, had nowhere else to go, in the famous Clinton-era expression. The party just didnt need to listen to them any longer.\r\n\r\nWhat Lewandowski and Nussbaum are saying, then, should be obvious to anyone whos dipped a toe outside the prosperous enclaves on the two coasts. Ill-considered trade deals and generous bank bailouts and guaranteed profits for insurance companies but no recovery for average people, ever  these policies have taken their toll. As Trump says, we have rebuilt China and yet our country is falling apart. Our infrastructure is falling apart  Our airports are, like, Third World.\r\n\r\nTrumps words articulate the populist backlash against liberalism that has been building slowly for decades and may very well occupy the White House itself, whereupon the entire world will be required to take seriously its demented ideas.\r\n\r\nYet still we cannot bring ourselves to look the thing in the eyes. We cannot admit that we liberals bear some of the blame for its emergence, for the frustration of the working-class millions, for their blighted cities and their downward spiraling lives. So much easier to scold them for their twisted racist souls, to close our eyes to the obvious reality of which Trumpism is just a crude and ugly expression: that neoliberalism has well and truly failed.\r\n\r\nThomas Frank is the author of Listen, Liberal or Whatever Happened to the Party of the People, published 15 March by Metropolitan Books\r\n\r\nThis article was amended on 9 March 2016 to reflect the fact that Nafta stands for the North American Free Trade Agreement.

    "text": "The list of Republicans supporting Hillary Clinton is still growing. For months, we have been keeping track of all of the GOP politicians, administration officials, business leaders and donors who have crossed over to back Clinton over Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nThe most recent high-profile announced was from former secretary of state Colin Powell. \"General Powell said at a meeting of the Long Island Association that he would be voting for Hillary Clinton,\" spokeswoman Peggy Cifrino said in late October. Powell added in a brief interview with The Post's Karen DeYoung that he picked Clinton \"because I think shes qualified, and the other gentleman is not qualified.\r\n\r\nPowell's support isn't much of a surprise, given his support for President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and clear distaste for Donald Trump. In his leaked emails from last month, Powell also appeared to be talking over the best time to announce his support for Clinton.\r\n\r\nBut at least it's official now. And Powell is now the third Bush Cabinet official to support Clinton.\r\n\r\nBelow is that list as it stands:\r\n\r\nFormer presidents (1?)\r\nGeorge H.W.

    "text": "There is a smug style in American liberalism. It has been growing these past decades. It is a way of conducting politics, predicated on the belief that American life is not divided by moral difference or policy divergence  not really  but by the failure of half the country to know what's good for them.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, the smug style has found expression in media and in policy, in the attitudes of liberals both visible and private, providing a foundational set of assumptions above which a great number of liberals comport their understanding of the world.\r\n\r\nIt has led an American ideology hitherto responsible for a great share of the good accomplished over the past century of our political life to a posture of reaction and disrespect: a condescending, defensive sneer toward any person or movement outside of its consensus, dressed up as a monopoly on reason.\r\n\r\nThe smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demography.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the middle of the 20th century, the working class, once the core of the coalition, began abandoning the Democratic Party. In 1948, in the immediate wake of Franklin Roosevelt, 66 percent of manual laborers voted for Democrats, along with 60 percent of farmers. In 1964, it was 55 percent of working-class voters. By 1980, it was 35 percent.\r\n\r\nThe white working class in particular saw even sharper declines. Despite historic advantages with both poor and middle-class white voters, by 2012 Democrats possessed only a 2-point advantage among poor white voters. Among white voters making between $30,000 and $75,000 per year, the GOP has taken a 17-point lead.\r\n\r\nFinding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful, hapless rubes, smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt\r\nThe consequence was a shift in liberalism's intellectual center of gravity. A movement once fleshed out in union halls and little magazines shifted into universities and major press, from the center of the country to its cities and elite enclaves. Minority voters remained, but bereft of the material and social capital required to dominate elite decision-making, they were largely excluded from an agenda driven by the new Democratic core: the educated, the coastal, and the professional.\r\n\r\nIt is not that these forces captured the party so much as it fell to them. When the laborer left, they remained.\r\n\r\nThe origins of this shift are overdetermined. Richard Nixon bears a large part of the blame, but so does Bill Clinton. The Southern Strategy, yes, but the destruction of labor unions, too. I have my own sympathies, but I do not propose to adjudicate that question here.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say, by the 1990s the better part of the working class wanted nothing to do with the word liberal. What remained of the American progressive elite was left to puzzle: What happened to our coalition?\r\n\r\nWhy did they abandon us?\r\n\r\nWhat's the matter with Kansas?\r\n\r\nThe smug style arose to answer these questions. It provided an answer so simple and so emotionally satisfying that its success was perhaps inevitable: the theory that conservatism, and particularly the kind embraced by those out there in the country, was not a political ideology at all.\r\n\r\nLearn more\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow politics makes us stupid\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that stupid hicks don't know what's good for them. They're getting conned by right-wingers and tent revivalists until they believe all the lies that've made them so wrong. They don't know any better. That's why they're voting against their own self-interest.\r\n\r\nAs anybody who has gone through a particularly nasty breakup knows, disdain cultivated in the aftermath of a divide quickly exceeds the original grievance. You lose somebody. You blame them. Soon, the blame is reason enough to keep them at a distance, the excuse to drive them even further away.\r\n\r\nFinding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful, hapless rubes, smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt. The result is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\r\n\r\nFinancial incentive compounded this tendency  there is money, after all, in reassuring the bitter. Over 20 years, an industry arose to cater to the smug style. It began in humor, and culminated for a time in The Daily Show, a program that more than any other thing advanced the idea that liberal orthodoxy was a kind of educated savvy and that its opponents were, before anything else, stupid. The smug liberal found relief in ridiculing them.\r\n\r\nThe internet only made it worse. Today, a liberal who finds himself troubled by the currents of contemporary political life need look no further than his Facebook newsfeed to find the explanation:\r\n\r\nStudy finds Daily Show viewers more informed than viewers of Fox News.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey're beating CNN watchers too.\r\n\r\nNPR listeners are best informed of all. He likes that.\r\n\r\nYou're better off watching nothing than watching Fox. He likes that even more.\r\n\r\nThe good news doesn't stop.\r\n\r\nLiberals aren't just better informed. They're smarter.\r\n\r\nThey've got better grammar. They know more words.\r\n\r\nSmart kids grow up to be liberals, while conservatives reason like drunks.\r\n\r\nLiberals are better able to process new information; they're less biased like that. They've got different brains. Better ones. Why? Evolution. They've got better brains, top-notch amygdalae, science finds.\r\n\r\nThe smug style created a feedback loop. If the trouble with conservatives was ignorance, then the liberal impulse was to correct it. When such corrections failed, disdain followed after it.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is a smug style in every political movement: elitism among every ideology believing itself in possession of the solutions to society's ills. But few movements have let the smug tendency so corrupt them, or make so tenuous its case against its enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Conservatives are always at a bit of a disadvantage in the theater of mass democracy,\" the conservative editorialist Kevin Williamson wrote in National Review last October, \"because people en masse aren't very bright or sophisticated, and they're vulnerable to cheap, hysterical emotional appeals.\"\r\n\r\nThe smug style thinks Williamson is wrong, of course, but not in principle. It's only that he's confused about who the hordes of stupid, hysterical people are voting for. The smug style reads Williamson and says, \"No! You!\"\r\n\r\nElites, real elites, might recognize one another by their superior knowledge. The smug recognize one another by their mutual knowing.\r\n\r\nKnowing, for example, that the Founding Fathers were all secular deists. Knowing that you're actually, like, 30 times more likely to shoot yourself than an intruder. Knowing that those fools out in Kansas are voting against their own self-interest and that the trouble is Kansas doesn't know any better. Knowing all the jokes that signal this knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe studies, about Daily Show viewers and better-sized amygdalae, are knowing. It is the smug style's first premise: a politics defined by a command of the Correct Facts and signaled by an allegiance to the Correct Culture. A politics that is just the politics of smart people in command of Good Facts. A politics that insists it has no ideology at all, only facts. No moral convictions, only charts, the kind that keep them from \"imposing their morals\" like the bad guys do.\r\n\r\nKnowing is the shibboleth into the smug style's culture, a cultural that celebrates hip commitments and valorizes hip taste, that loves nothing more than hate-reading anyone who doesn't get them. A culture that has come to replace politics itself.\r\n\r\nThe knowing know that police reform, that abortion rights, that labor unions are important, but go no further: What is important, after all, is to signal that you know these things. What is important is to launch links and mockery at those who don't. The Good Facts are enough: Anybody who fails to capitulate to them is part of the Problem, is terminally uncool. No persuasion, only retweets. Eye roll, crying emoji, forward to John Oliver for sick burns.\r\n\r\nThe smug style has always existed in American liberalism, but it wasn't always so totalizing. Lionel Trilling claimed, as far back as 1950, that liberalism \"is not only the dominant, but even the sole intellectual tradition,\" that \"the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse ... do not express themselves in ideas, but only in action or in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.\"\r\n\r\nThe smug style has always existed in American liberalism, but it wasn't always so totalizing\r\nRichard Hofstadter, the historian whose most famous work, The Paranoid Style in American Politics, this essay exists in some obvious reference to, advanced a similar line in writing not so well-remembered today. His then-influential history writing drips with disdain for rubes who regard themselves as victimized by economics and history, who have failed to maintain correct political attitudes.\r\n\r\nBut 60 years ago, American liberalism relied too much on the support of working people to let these ideas take too much hold. Even its elitists, its Schlesingers and Bells, were tempered by the power of the labor movement, by the role Marxism still played in even liberal politics  forces too powerful to allow non-elite concerns to entirely escape the liberal mental horizon. Walter Reuther, and Bayard Rustin, and A. Philip Randolph were still in the room, and they mattered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSixty years ago, the ugliest tendencies were still private, too. The smug style belonged to real elites, knowing in their cocktail parties, far from the ears of rubes. But today we have television, and the internet, and a liberalism worked out in universities and think tanks. Today, the better part of liberalism is Trillings  or those who'd like to be, at any rate  and everyone can hear them.\r\n\r\nOn June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court found that denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples constituted a violation of the 14th Amendment. After decades of protests, legislation, setbacks, and litigation, the 13 states still holding out against the inevitable were ordered to relent. Kim Davis, a clerk tasked with issuing marriage licenses to couples in her Kentucky county, refused.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of six months, it is surprising that she was, beyond a few short-lived and empty efforts, the only civil bureaucrat to do so. One imagines a hundred or a thousand Kim Davises in the country, small administrators with small power, outraged by the collapse of a moral fight that they were winning just a few years prior.\r\n\r\nIn the days between the June decision and the July 1 announcement that the American Civil Liberties Union would represent four couples who had been denied marriage licenses by the Rowan County Clerk's office, many braced for resistance. Surely compliance would come hard in some places. Surely, some of the losers would refuse to give up. There was something giddy about it  at long last, the good guys would be the ones bearing down with the full force of the law.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long for the law to correct Davis. On August 12, a judge ordered a stay, preventing Davis from refusing any further under the protection of the law. The Sixth Circuit, and then the Supreme Court, refused to hear her appeal.\r\n\r\nDespite further protest and Davis's ultimate jailing for contempt of court, normal service was restored in short order. The 23,000 people of Rowan Country suffered, all told, slightly less than seven weeks without a functioning civil licensure apparatus.\r\n\r\nDavis remained a fixation. Dour, rural, thrice divorced but born again  Twitter could not have invented a better parody of the uncool. She was ridiculed for her politics but also for her looks  that she had been married so many times was inexplicable! That she thought she had the slightest grasp of the Constitution, doubly so.\r\n\r\nWhen Davis was jailed for five days following her refusal to comply with the court order, many who pride themselves on having a vastly more compassionate moral foundation than Davis cheered the imprisonment of a political foe.\r\n\r\nThe ridicule of Davis became so pronounced that even smug circles, always on the precipice of self-reproach, began eventually to rein in the excess. Mocking her appearance, openly celebrating the incarceration of an ideological opponent  these were not good looks.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKim Davis at a rally in September 2015 (Ty Wright/Getty Images)\r\n\r\nBut a more fundamental element of smug disdain for Kim Davis went unchallenged: the contention, at bottom, that Davis was not merely wrong in her convictions, but that her convictions were, in themselves, an error and a fraud.\r\n\r\nThat is: Kim Davis was not only on the wrong side of the law. She was not even a subscriber to a religious ideology that had found itself at moral odds with American culture. Rather, she was a subscriber to nothing, a hateful bigot who did not even understand her own religion.\r\n\r\nChristianity, as many hastened to point out, is about love. Christ commands us to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. If the Bible took any position on the issue at all, it was that divorce, beloved by Davis, was a sin, and that she was a hypocrite masquerading among the faithful.\r\n\r\nHow many of these critiques were issued by atheists?\r\n\r\nThis, more than anything I can recall in recent American life, is an example of the smug style. Many liberals do not believe that evangelical Christianity ought to guide public life; many believe, moreover, that the moral conceits of that Christianity are wrong, even harmful to society. But to the smug liberal, it isn't that Kim Davis is wrong. How can she be? She's only mistaken. She just doesn't know the Good Facts, even about her own religion. She's angry and confused, another hick who's not with it.\r\n\r\nIt was an odd thing to assert in the case of Christianity, a religion that until recently was taken to be another shibboleth of the uncool, not a loving faith misunderstood by bigots. But this is knowing: knowing that the new line on Jesus is that the homophobes just don't get their own faith.\r\n\r\nKim Davis was behind the times. Her beliefs did not represent a legitimate challenge to liberal consensus because they did not represent a challenge at all: They were incoherent, at odds with the Good Facts. Google makes every man a theologian.\r\n\r\nThis, I think, is fundamental to understanding the smug style. If good politics and good beliefs are just Good Facts and good tweets  that is, if there is no ideology beyond sensible conclusions drawn from a rational assessment of the world  then there are no moral fights, only lying liars and the stupid rubes who believe them.\r\n\r\nWhen Davis was first released from county jail, Mike Huckabee went to meet her. But the smug style sees no true ideology there, no moral threat to contend with. Only a huckster and a hick: one to be ridiculed, and the other to be refuted. What more, the smug man posts, could there be to say about it? They're idiots! Look, look: This Onion article nails it.\r\n\r\nPopular story:\r\n\r\nAdlai Stevenson, Democratic candidate for president, is on parade. A band is playing. Onlookers cheer. He waves to the crowd.\r\n\r\nA woman shouts: \"Gov. Stevenson, you have the vote of every thinking person in this country!\"\r\n\r\nStevenson replies: \"Thank you, ma'am, but we need a majority.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe smug style says to itself, Yeah. I really am one of the few thinking people in this country, aren't I?\r\n\r\nIn November of last year, during the week when it became temporarily fashionable for American governors to declare that Syrian refugees would not be welcome in their state, Hamilton Nolan wrote an essay for Gawker called \"Dumb Hicks Are America's Greatest Threat.\"\r\n\r\nIf there has ever been a tirade so dedicated to the smug style, to the proposition that it is neither malice, nor capital, nor ideological difference, but rather the backward stupidity of poor people that has ruined the state of American policy, then it is hidden beyond our view, in some uncool place, far from the front page of Gawker.\r\n\r\nLearn more\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhy have weddings and houses gotten so ridiculously expensive? Blame inequality.\r\n\r\n\"Many of America's political leaders are warning of the dangers posed by Syrian refugees. They are underestimating, though, the much greater danger: dumbass hicks, in charge of things,\" Nolan wrote. \"...You, our elected officials, are embarrassing us. All of us, except your fellow dumb hicks, who voted for you in large numbers. You  our racist, xenophobic, knuckle-dragging ignorant leaders  are making us look bad in front of the guests (the whole world). You are the bad cousin in the family who always ruins Thanksgiving. Go in the back room and drink a can of beer alone please.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the dumb hicks Nolan identifies are \"many Southern mayors\" and \"many lesser known state representatives.\" He cites the Ku Klux Klan  \"exclusively dumbass hicks,\" he writes. \"100%,\" he emphasizes  despite the fact that the New York Times, in an investigation of white supremacist members of Stormfront.org, found that \"the top reported interest of Stormfront members is reading.\" That they are \"news and political junkies.\" Despite the fact that if \"you come compare Stormfront users to people who go to the Yahoo News site, it turns out that the Stormfront crowd is twice as likely to visit nytimes.com.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have long threads praising Breaking Bad and discussing the comparative merits of online dating sites, like Plenty of Fish and OKCupid,\" the Times reports.\r\n\r\nIn another piece, published later the same month, Nolan wrote that \"Inequality of wealth  or, if you like, the distribution of wealth in our society in a way that results in poverty  is not just one issue among many. It is the root from which blooms nearly all major social problems.\"\r\n\r\nHe's right about that. But who does he imagine is responsible for this inequality? The poor? The dumb? The hicks?\r\n\r\nHamilton Nolan isn't stupid. He has even, lately, argued that even the worst of the rubes must be allies in class struggle. Yet the trouble is still swallowing what \"motherfuckers\" those people are.\r\n\r\nNolan is perhaps the funniest and most articulate of those pointing fingers at the \"dumbass hicks,\" but he isn't alone. It is evidently intolerable to a huge swath of liberalism to confess the obvious: that those responsible have homes in Brooklyn, too. That they buy the same smartphones. That they too are on Twitter. That the oligarchs are making fun of stupid poor people too. That they're better at it, and always will be.\r\n\r\nNo: The trouble must be out there, somewhere. In the country. Where the idiots are; where the hicks are too stupid to know where problems blossom.\r\n\r\n\"To the dumb hick leaders of America, I say: (nothing). You wouldn't listen anyhow,\" Nolan writes. \"My words would go in one ear and right out the other. Like talking to an old block of wood.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a shame. They might be receptive to his concerns about poverty.\r\n\r\nIf there is a single person who exemplifies the dumbass hick in the smug imagination, it is former President George W. Bush. He's got the accent. He can't talk right. He seems stupefied by simple concepts, and his politics are all gee-whiz Texas ignorance. He is the ur-hick. He is the enemy.\r\n\r\nHe got all the way to White House, and he's still being taken for a ride by the scheming rightwing oligarchs around him  just like those poor rubes in Kansas. If only George knew Dick Cheney wasn't acting in his own best interests!\r\n\r\nIt is worth considering that Bush is the son of a president, a patrician born in Connecticut and educated at Andover and Harvard and Yale.\r\n\r\nIt is worth considering that he does not come from a family known for producing poor minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is worth considering that beginning with his 1994 gubernatorial debate against Ann Richards, and at every juncture thereafter, opponents have been defeated after days of media outlets openly speculating whether George was up to the mental challenge of a one-on-one debate.\r\n\r\n\"Throughout his short political career,\" ABC's Katy Textor wrote on the eve of the 2000 debates against Al Gore, \"Bush has benefited from low expectations of his debating abilities. The fact that he skipped no less than three GOP primary debates, and the fact that he was reluctant to agree to the Commission on Presidential Debates proposal, has done little to contradict the impression of a candidate uncomfortable with this unavoidable fact of campaign life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done little to contradict.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\nGeorge W. Bush and Al Gore during a presidential debate in 2000. (Tannen Maury/AFP/Getty Images)\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 2000, during his final pre-election stump speech, Bush explained his history of political triumph thusly: \"They misunderesimated me.\"\r\n\r\nWhat an idiot. American liberals made fun of him for that one for years.\r\n\r\nIt is worth considering that he didn't misspeak.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did, however, deliberately cultivate the confusion. He understood the smug style. He wagered that many liberals, eager to see their opponents as intellectually deficient, would buy into the act and thereby miss the more pernicious fact of his moral deficits.\r\n\r\nHe wagered correctly. Smug liberals said George was too stupid to get elected, too stupid to get reelected, too stupid to pass laws or appoint judges or weather a political fight. Liberals misunderestimated George W. Bush all eight years of his presidency.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Bush is not a dumbass hick. In eight years, all the sick Daily Show burns in the world did not appreciably undermine his agenda.\r\n\r\nThe smug mind defends itself against these charges. Oh, we're just having fun, it says. We don't mean it. This is just for a laugh, it's just a joke, stop being so humorless.\r\n\r\nIt is exasperating, after all, to have to live in a country where so many people are so aggressively wrong about so much, they say. You go on about ideology and shibboleths and knowing, but we are right on the issues, aren't we? We are right on social policy and right on foreign policy and right on evolution, and same-sex marriage, and climate change too. Surely that's what matters.\r\n\r\nWe don't really mean they're all stupid  but hey, lay off. We're not smug! This is just how we vent our frustration. Otherwise it would be too depressing having to share a country with these people!\r\n\r\nWe have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief and not, for instance, the animating public strategy of an entire wing of the liberal culture apparatus. The Daily Show, as it happens, is not the private entertainment of elites blowing off some steam. It is broadcast on national television.\r\n\r\nTwitter isn't private. Not that anybody with the sickest burn to accompany the smartest chart would want it to be. Otherwise, how would everyone know how in-the-know you are?\r\n\r\nThe rubes have seen your videos. You posted it on their wall.\r\n\r\nStill don't get why liberal opinion is correct? This video settles the debate for good.\r\n\r\nI have been wondering for a long time how it is that so many entries to the op-ed pages take it as their justifying premise that they are arguing for a truth that has never been advanced before.\r\n\r\nWe have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief\r\n\"It's an accepted, nearly unchallenged assumption that Muslim communities across the U.S. have a problem  that their youth tend toward violent ideology, or are susceptible to \"radicalization\" by groups like the Islamic State,\" began an editorial that appeared last December in the New York Times. But \"after all,\" it goes on, \"the majority of mass shootings in America are perpetrated by white men but no one questions what might have radicalized them in their communities.\"\r\n\r\nBut this contention  that Muslims possess superlative violent tendencies  has been challenged countless times, hasn't it? It was challenged here, and here and here as far back as 9/11. The president of the United State challenged it on national television the night before this editorial was published. The Times itself did too. The myopic provincialism of anybody who believes that Muslims are a uniquely violent people is the basis of a five-year-old Onion headline, not some new moral challenge.\r\n\r\nThe smug style leaves its adherents no other option: If an idea has failed to take hold, if the Good Facts are not widely accepted, then the problem must be that these facts have not yet reached the disbelievers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December 2015, Public Policy Polling found that 30 percent of Republicans were in favor of bombing Agrabah, the Arab-sounding fictional city from Disney's Aladdin. Hilarious.\r\n\r\nPPP has run joke questions before, of course: polling the popularity of Deez Nuts, or asking after God's job approval. But these questions, at least, let their audience in on the gag. Now liberalism is deliberately setting up the last segment of the population actually willing to endure a phone survey in service of what it knew would make for some hilarious copy when the rubes inevitably fell for it. This is not a survey in service of a joke  it is a survey in service of a human punchline.\r\n\r\nAs if only Republicans covered up gaps in their knowledge by responding to what they assume is a good-faith question by guessing from their general principles.\r\n\r\nIt may be easy to mistake with the private venting of frustrated elites, but the rubes can read the New York Times, too. It is not where liberals whisper to each other about the secret things that go unchallenged. Poll respondents are not the secret fodder for a joke.\r\n\r\nLearn more\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"Late-breaking sexism\": why younger women arent excited about electing a woman president\r\n\r\nThis is the consequence of \"private\" venting, and it is the consequence of knowing too: If good politics comes solely from good data and good sense, it cannot be that large sections of the American public are merely wrong about so many vital things. It cannot be that they have heard our arguments but rejected them  that might mean we must examine our own methods of persuasion.\r\n\r\nNo: it is only that the wrong beliefs are unchallenged  that their believers are trapped in \"information bubbles\" and confirmation bias. That no one knows the truth, except the New York Times (or Vox). If only we could tell them, question them, show them this graph. If they don't get it then, well, then they're hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe smug style plays out in private too, of course. If you haven't started one yourself, you've surely seen the Facebook threads: Ten or 20 of Brooklyn's finest gather to say how exasperated they are, these days, by the stupidity of the American public.\r\n\r\n\"I just don't know what to do about these people,\" one posts. \"I think we have to accept that a lot of people are just misinformed!\" replies another. \"Like, I think they actually don't want to know anything that would undermine their worldview.\"\r\n\r\nThey tend to do it in the comment section, under an article about how conservatives are difficult to persuade because they isolate themselves in mutually reinforcing information bubbles.\r\n\r\nWhat have been the consequences of the smug style?\r\n\r\nIt has become a tradition for the smug, in editorials and essay and confident Facebook boasting, to assume that the presidential debates will feature their candidate, in command of the facts, wiping the floor with the empty huckster ignorance of their Republican opponent.\r\n\r\nIt was popularly assumed, for a time, that George W. Bush was too stupid to be elected president.\r\n\r\nThe smug believed the same of Ronald Reagan.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Yoo, the architect of the Bush administration's torture policies, escaped The Daily Show unscathed. Liberals wondered what to do when Jon Stewart fails. What would success look like? Were police waiting in the wings, a one-way ticket to the Hague if Stewart nailed him?\r\n\r\nIt would be unfair to say that the smug style has never learned from these mistakes. But the lesson has been, We underestimated how many people could be fooled.\r\n\r\nThat is: We underestimated just how dumb these dumb hicks really are.\r\n\r\nWe just didn't get our message to them. They just stayed in their information bubble. We can't let the lying liars keep lying to these people  but how do we reach these idiots who only trust Fox?\r\n\r\n\r\nRarely: Maybe they're savvier than we thought. Maybe they're angry for a reason.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, reasons aren't too difficult to come by.\r\n\r\nDuring a San Francisco fundraiser in the 2008 primary campaign, Barack Obama offered an observation that was hailed not without some glee as the first unforced error from then-Senator Cool.\r\n\r\n\"You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania,\" Obama said, \"and, like, a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate, and they have not. And it's not surprising then they get bitter. They cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.\"\r\n\r\nIt's the latter part that we remember eight years later  the clinging to guns and religion and hate  but it is the first part that was important: the part about lost jobs and neglect by two presidential administrations.\r\n\r\nObama's observation was not novel.\r\n\r\nThe notion that material loss and abandonment have driven America's white working class into a fit of resentment is boilerplate for even the Democratic Party's tepid left these days. But in the president's formulation and in the formulation of smug stylists who have embraced some material account of uncool attitudes, the downturn, the jobs lost and the opportunities narrowed, are a force of nature  something that has \"been happening\" in the passive voice.\r\n\r\nIf the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence, it's, Why are they voting against their own self-interest?\r\nThis, I suspect, will one day become the Republican Party's rationale for addressing climate change: Look, we don't know how the dead hooker wound up in the hotel room. But she's here now, that's undeniable, so we've gotta get rid of the body.\r\n\r\nToday, it is the excuse of American smug mind: Where did all of these poor people come from?\r\n\r\nIf pressed for an answer, I suppose they would say Republicans, elected by rubes voting against their own self-interest. Reagan, Gingrich, Bush  all those Bad Factknowing halfwits who were too dumb to get elected to anything.\r\n\r\nWell, sure. In the past 30 years of American life, the Republican Party has dedicated itself to replacing every labor law with a photo of Ronald Reagan's face.\r\n\r\nBut this does not excuse liberals beating full retreat to the colleges and the cities, abandoning the dispossessed to their fate. It does not excuse surrendering a century of labor politics in the name of electability. It does not excuse gazing out decades later to find that those left behind are not up on the latest thought and deciding, We didn't abandon them. The idiots didn't want to be saved.\r\n\r\nIt was not Ronald Reagan who declared the era of big government. It was not the GOP that decided the coastally based, culturally liberal industries of technology, Hollywood, and high finance were the future of the American economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence, it's, Why are they voting against their own self-interest? But no party these past decades has effectively represented the interests of these dispossessed. Only one has made a point of openly disdaining them too.\r\n\r\nAbandoned and without any party willing to champion their interests, people cling to candidates who, at the very least, are willing to represent their moral convictions. The smug style resents them for it, and they resent the smug in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rubes noticed that liberal Democrats, distressed by the notion that Indiana would allow bakeries to practice open discrimination against LGBTQ couples, threatened boycotts against the state, mobilizing the considerable economic power that comes with an alliance of New York and Hollywood and Silicon Valley to punish retrograde Gov. Mike Pence, but had no such passion when the same governor of the same state joined 21 others in refusing the Medicaid expansion. No doubt good liberals objected to that move too. But I've yet to see a boycott threat about it.\r\n\r\nEarly in the marriage equality fight, activists advanced the theory that when people discovered a friend or relative was gay, they became far more likely to support gay rights. They were correct. These days it is difficult for anybody in a position of liberal power  whether in business, or government, or media  to avoid having openly gay colleagues, colleagues whom they like and whom they'd like to help.\r\n\r\nBut few opinion makers fraternize with the impoverished. Few editors and legislators and Silicon Valley heroes have dinner with the lovely couple on food stamps down the road, much less those scraping by in Indiana.\r\n\r\nIf any single event provided the direct impetus for this essay, it was a running argument I had with an older, liberal writer over the seriousness of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Since June 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy, this writer has taken it upon himself each day to tell his Facebook followers that Donald Trump is a bad kind of dude.\r\n\r\nThat saying as much was the key to stopping him and his odious followers too.\r\n\r\n\"Ridicule is the most powerful weapon we have against any of our enemies,\" he told me in the end, \"but especially against the ones who, not incorrectly, take it so personally and lash out in ways that shine klieg lights on those very flaws we detest.\r\n\r\n\"If you're laughing at someone, you're certainly not respecting him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyway,\" he went on, \"I'm done talking to you. We see the world differently. I'm fine with that. We don't need to be friends.\"\r\n\r\nRidicule is the most effective political tactic.\r\n\r\n\r\nRidicule is especially effective when it's personal and about expressing open disdain for stupid, bad people.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical legitimacy is granted by the respect of elite liberals.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can't be legitimate if you're the butt of our jokes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don't agree, we can't work together politically.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can't even be friends, because politics is social.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause politics is performative  if we don't mock together, we aren't on the same side.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is a bingo card for the smug style somewhere, then cross off every square. You've won.\r\n\r\nI would be less troubled if I did not believe that the smug style has captured an enormous section of American liberalism. If I believed that its politics, as practiced by its supporters, extended beyond this line of thought. If this were an exception.\r\n\r\nBut even as many have come around to the notion that Trump is the prohibitive favorite for his party's nomination, the smug interpretation has been predictable: We only underestimated how hateful, how stupid, the Republican base can be.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA Donald Trump rally in Pittsburgh. (Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)\r\n\r\nTrump capturing the nomination will not dispel the smug style; if anything, it will redouble it. Faced with the prospect of an election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the smug will reach a fever pitch: six straight months of a sure thing, an opportunity to mock and scoff and ask, How could anybody vote for this guy? until a morning in November when they ask, What the fuck happened?\r\n\r\nOn March 20, Salon's David Masciotra wrote that if Trump \"actually had the strength to articulate uncomfortable and inconvenient truths, he would turn his favorite word  'loser'  ??not on full-time professionals in the press, but on his supporters.\"\r\n\r\nMasciotra goes on:\r\n\r\nJournalists found that in the counties where Trump is most dominant, there are large numbers of white high school dropouts, and unemployed people no longer looking for work. An alliance with the incoherent personality cult of Donald Trump's candidacy correlates strongly with failure to obtain a high school diploma, and withdrawal from the labor force. The counties also have a consistent history of voting for segregationists, and have an above average percentage of its residents living in mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe kicker: \"Many conservatives, and even some kindhearted liberals, might object to the conclusions one can draw from the data as stereotyping, but the empirical evidence leaves little choice. Donald Trump's supporters confirm the stereotype against them.\"\r\n\r\nHere's the conclusion I draw: If Donald Trump has a chance in November, it is because the knowing will dictate our strategy. Unable to countenance the real causes of their collapse, they will comfort with own impotence by shouting, \"Idiots!\" again and again, angrier and angrier, the handmaidens of their own destruction.\r\n\r\nThe smug style resists empathy for the unknowing. It denies the possibility of a politics whereby those who do not share knowing culture, who do not like the right things or know the Good Facts or recognize the intellectual bankruptcy of their own ideas can be worked with, in spite of these differences, toward a common goal.\r\n\r\nIt is this attitude that has driven the dispossessed into the arms of a candidate who shares their fury. It is this attitude that may deliver him the White House, a \"serious\" threat, a threat to be mocked and called out and hated, but not to be taken seriously. \r\n\r\nThe wages of smug is Trump.\r\n\r\nNothing is more confounding to the smug style than the fact that the average Republican is better educated and has a higher IQ than the average Democrat. That for every overpowered study finding superior liberal open-mindedness and intellect and knowledge, there is one to suggest that Republicans have the better of these qualities.\r\n\r\nMost damning, perhaps, to the fancy liberal self-conception: Republicans score higher in susceptibility to persuasion. They are willing to change their minds more often.\r\n\r\nThe Republican coalition tends toward the center: educated enough, smart enough, informed enough.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic coalition in the 21st century is bifurcated: It has the postgraduates, but it has the disenfranchised urban poor as well, a group better defined by race and immigration status than by class. There are more Americans without high school diplomas than in possession of doctoral degrees. The math proceeds from there.\r\n\r\nThe smug style takes this as a defense. Elite liberalism, and the Democratic Party by extension, cannot hate poor people, they say. We aren't smug! Just look at our coalition. These aren't rubes. Just look at our embrace of their issues.\r\n\r\nBut observe how quickly professed concern for the oppressed becomes another shibboleth for the smug, another kind of knowing. Mere awareness of these issues becomes the most important thing, the capacity to articulate them a new subset of Correct Facts.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the know has read \"The Case for Reparations,\" but it was the reading and performed admiration that counted, praised in the same breath as, \"It is a better history than an actual case for actually paying, of course...\"\r\n\r\nPretend for a moment that all of it is true. That the smug style apprehended the world as it really is, that knowing  or knowing, no inflection  did make our political divide. That the problem is the rubes. That the dumbass hicks are to blame. They can't help it: Their brains don't work. They isolate themselves from all the Good Facts, and they're being taken for a ride by con men.\r\n\r\nPretend the ridicule worked too: that the videos and the Twitter burns and destroying the opposition made all the bad guys go away.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of world would it leave us? An endless cycle of jokes? Of sick burns and smart tweets and knowing? Relative to whom? The smug style demands an object of disdain; it would find a new one quickly.\r\n\r\nIt is central to the liberal self-conception that what separates them from reactionaries is a desire to help people, a desire to create a fairer and more just world. Liberals still want, or believe they still want, to make a more perfect union.\r\n\r\nWhether you believe they are deluded or not, whether you believe this project is worthwhile in any form or not, what I am trying to tell you is that the smug style has fundamentally undermined even the aspiration, that it has made American liberalism into the worst version of itself.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them. It becomes all at once too easy to decide you know best, to never hear, much less ignore, protest to the contrary.\r\n\r\nAt present, many of those most in need of the sort of help liberals believe they can provide despise liberalism, and are despised in turn. Is it surprising that with each decade, the \"help\" on offer drifts even further from the help these people need?\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them\r\nEven if the two could be separated, would it be worth it? What kind of political movement is predicated on openly disdaining the very people it is advocating for?\r\n\r\nThe smug style, at bottom, is a failure of empathy. Further: It is a failure to believe that empathy has any value at all. It is the notion that anybody worthy of liberal time and attention and respect must capitulate, immediately, to the Good Facts.\r\n\r\nIf they don't (and they won't) you're free to write them off and mock them. When they suffer, it's their just desserts.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake: I am not suggesting that liberals adopt a fuzzy, gentler version of their politics. I am not suggesting they compromise their issues for the sake of playing nice. What I am suggesting is that the battles waged by liberalism have drifted far away from their old egalitarian intentions.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting that open disdain for the people they say they want to help has led them to stop helping those people, too.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting that in the case of a Kim Davis, liberalism resist the impulse to go beyond the necessary legal fight and explicitly delight in punishing an old foe.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting that they instead wonder what it might be like to have little left but one's values; to wake up one day to find your whole moral order destroyed; to look around and see the representatives of a new order call you a stupid, hypocritical hick without bothering, even, to wonder how your corner of your poor state found itself so alienated from them in the first place. To work with people who do not share their values or their tastes, who do not live where they live or like what they like or know their Good Facts or their jokes.\r\n\r\nThis is not a call for civility. Manners are not enough. The smug style did not arise by accident, and it cannot be abolished with a little self-reproach. So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class, they will search for reasons to justify that failure. They will resent them. They will find, over and over, how easy it is to justify abandoning them further.  They will choose the smug style.\r\n\r\nMaybe the cycle is too deeply set already. Perhaps the divide, the disdain, the whole crack-up are inevitable. But if liberal good intentions are to make a play for a better future, they cannot merely recognize the ways they've come to hate their former allies. They must begin to mend the ways they lost them in the first place.",

    "text": "Heres the nations would-be first lady  and right beside her, a second lady.\r\n\r\nThree years before she met husband Donald Trump, Melania Trump was snapped in a nude frolic with another female model, bombshell photos obtained exclusively by The Post show.\r\n\r\nModal Trigger\r\n\r\nThe lesbian-themed pics are from a two-day photo shoot in Manhattan in 1995, when Melania Knauss, as she was called, was 25 years old and modeling under the name Melania K.\r\n\r\n(Photographer Al de Basseville later told The Post that he misspoke, and the photo session actually took place in 1996 in Manhattan, and appeared in a 1997 issue of the magazine.)\r\n\r\nSeveral were featured in Max Magazine, a now-defunct French mens monthly, more than 20 years ago. Others have never been in print  until now.\r\n\r\nThe raciest of the photos shows Melania lying nude in a bed as Scandinavian model Emma Eriksson, also naked, embraces her from behind, just below her breasts, which are fully exposed.\r\n\r\nIn another photo, Eriksson wears sheer stockings, a low-cut bustier, high heels and a long robe  all designed by John Galliano  and raises a whip as if preparing to spank Melania, who pretends to recoil. Melania is more conservatively dressed in a skin-tight gown and high heels.\r\n\r\nI always loved women together, because I have been with a lot of women who desired the mnage  trois, said Jarl Ale de Basseville, the French fashion photographer who snapped the pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMelania Trump (right) poses for the January 1997 issue of Max Magazine.Photo: Jarl Ale de Basseville\r\nThis is beauty and not porn. I am always shocked by the porn industry because they are destroying the emotion and the essence of purity and simplicity.\r\n\r\nPart of the shoot, which de Basseville said was inspired by Renaissance art, took place on the buildings rooftop, said a fashion-industry insider who was present at one of the photo sessions.\r\n\r\nMelania behaved like a true professional during one of the nighttime shoots with Eriksson, the source said.\r\n\r\nShe was charming throughout, said the source, adding that the pics lesbian theme didnt faze her. She was always smiling, with a very pleasant personality and was polite and very well educated.\r\n\r\n\r\nAl de BassevillePhoto: Al de Basseville\r\nMelania had recently arrived in the city from modeling stints in Paris and Milan at the time. In Gotham, she was booked for mostly commercial work and was later featured in an ad for Camel cigarettes, the source told The Post.\r\n\r\nHer sexy photo spread appeared in the January 1996 issue of Max Magazine, whose cover featured a photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the lesbian-themed shots, de Basseville took several nude pictures of Melania from different angles.\r\n\r\nIn one of them, Melania pouts at the camera while clad only in stilettos. In another, her back is to the camera, and her arms are raised as if up against a wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n0:00\r\n/\r\n1:10\r\n \r\nI think it is important to show the beauty and freedom of the woman, and I am very proud of these pictures because they celebrate Melanias beauty,  de Basseville said.\r\n\r\nAsked about the photos, Donald Trump said: Melania was one of the most successful models, and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines.

    "text": "I like authenticity, especially as compared to survey-tested or heavily spun. I am prepared to let a candidate say something that I dont completely agree with and still support him or her. I think the need to be politically correct has gone too far. I also think the media often hypes and slants stories to the point of being untruthful.\r\n\r\nI think a prosperous middle class is the key to the American success story, both economically and politically, and that lobbyists have way too much sway. I am very much a pragmatist, so much so that I like compromise more than I like ideology. I like deals, especially those that are win-win. \r\n\r\nSo Donald Trump is my candidate, right? He is NOT!\r\n\r\nIn 1987, when I was 35 years old and he was 41, Donald Trump hired me to be his attorney on a major northern New Jersey project, a shopping center, which like everything else, was to bear his name, Trump Centre. It was a big deal that he picked me and a high honor for me just a couple of years after I started my law firm, which is now over 30 years old. This was at a time when Trump still built things, having recently finished Trump Tower. \r\n\r\n[Ill never forget when] my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words want me.\r\nHe seemed to me smart, business savvy, decisive. He had a very impressive office, a fancy and very big boat, an airline, a helicopter shuttle and several casinos. Within a few years, virtually all of this would be lost because of bad business decisions. Lots of lawyers have worked for Donald Trump; lots and lots. I am no Roy Cohn ? neither as aggressive nor (hopefully) nearly as ethically-challenged ? but I did know well how to get very tough land use matters through an always challenging application process in New Jersey. I was thrilled when he hired me.\r\n\r\nAfter the initial interview, my client contact with Donald was actually not very much. One low point I do remember (actually will never forget) is a limousine ride to a meeting with the editorial board of a New Jersey newspaper in which my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words want me. I was just plain shocked and embarrassed, but I kept smiling. I wanted and needed this client happy. \r\n\r\nWhile I was working for Donald, various press reports had Trump and his then-wife Ivanna living in a personal apartment in the Trump Tower of 8, 16 and even 20 or 30 rooms. Genuinely curious, I once asked him how many rooms the apartment actually had. I will never forget his response to me: However many they will print.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump was then, as he is now, larger than life, particularly in his own eyes, and at the same time frighteningly small, with very little moral grounding. He was then, and still is, all ego and show. \r\n\r\nI once asked him how many rooms [his] apartment actually had. I will never forget his response to me: However many they will print.\r\nI have thought about this a lot, and I want to share my humble insights of why we cannot elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. To me, it is more about character than politics. Because of lack of the former, the latter ? the actual politics of Donald Trump ? are not that easy to discern.\r\n\r\nOnce I got going with my reasons why Donald would not be good for our country, it was hard to stop. I did stop, however, when I hit 20, about 4,000 words from here. Read on if you are interested.\r\n\r\n1. The man lies all the time.\r\n\r\nLike the skilled liar he is, he does it with impunity. I watched in Jersey City, NJ when thousands and thousands of people were cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed. The last quarter the gross domestic product was less than zero. The number of illegal immigrants in the United States is 30 million, it could be 34 million.  The Mexican government forces bad people into our country. The unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent. \r\n\r\nAll these things have been said by Donald, actually often yelled by him, and many times over and over in front of large crowds. How about the whopper, Crime statistics show blacks kill 81 percent of white homicide victims? One has to wonder why this lie would be conceived, much less told. Donald Trump says all of these things forcefully, so they must be true. But they are not! \r\n\r\nUnambiguously, they are what is described as pants on fire untruthful, as in, not a shred of truth. In passing, you have to ponder whether yet another of Donald Trumps oft made statements about the fervor of his Christianity and the Bible being his favorite book are also not grounded in truth. Clearly, thou shall not lie is not his favorite of the Ten Commandments.\r\n\r\n2. It is actually not all about the candidate.\r\n\r\nIts amazing how often I am right? I alone can fix this. I have a big brain. I advise myself. I am very, very rich. \r\n\r\nDonald really said all these things. His ego seems to know no bounds. When Donald feels insulted by someone, he obsesses without control. He fusses, he fumes, and he says unbelievably inappropriate things. He is in his glory when he can bully his way to a result he covets.\r\n\r\nHis ego seems to know no bounds. When Donald feels insulted by someone, he obsesses without control.\r\nDid you ever notice that those real people stories other candidates are always telling about someone they just met, struggling with a difficult problem, are just not in the Trump lexicon? He keeps telling us he is all about winners. I guess these folks dont qualify. Said another way, Donald Trump doesnt play well in the sandbox with others.\r\n\r\nFirst, he has his own ideas as to who can be in the sandbox with him. He also wants to run the sandbox. He is the kid who gets his way or stomps off in a huff. What happens when he figures out, even our nations highest office is not all about him? Do we want him with the codes to nuclear weapons?\r\n\r\n3. U.S. presidents are by design not kings. \r\n\r\nThe Constitution makes them share power. Donald Trump who uses the I word more than anyone who has ever aspired to the job, has a brazenly authoritarian bent. He wants to be a strongman, not a president. \r\n\r\nOne has to wonder what would happen if he actually had to govern or make one of his deals in a zero sum world of politics where the other side just says no. What then of his notoriously short attention span, temper or non-stop need to tweet his every frustration?\r\n\r\n4. The devil IS in the details.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONATHAN DRAKE / REUTERS\r\nDonald Trump holds a sign supporting his plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico that he borrowed from a member of the audience at his campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina March 9, 2016.\r\nWinning so much we will get tired of winning, Make good deals with China, or even Make America great again are slogans that dont actually say anything. We are not stupid; share some details with us, so we can figure out whether you know what you are talking about. For Donald, however, in the few instances when specifics do follow, like perhaps the 1,000-mile, 35-55 foot wall or the deportation of 11 million immigrants, the details never come.\r\n\r\nNever are we told that to build the wall, even to the lower 35 feet, (by actual construction estimates) would cost $25 billion dollars, even if you could get the land to build it (most of the border Trump wants to wall is in the middle of a river and land in many cases could not even be secured for a fence).\r\n\r\nHis magic to make Mexico pay for it? The only suggestion I have heard is take it out of remittances from folks mailing money back home or one of his 45 percent tariffs. How is that going to work for the Americans sending the money to relatives or all of us paying 45 percent more for Mexican-made merchandise or the American company doing the manufacturing? How about the fact that the wall would do little to stop illegal immigration, more of which is overstays of visitors than over the border and likely will generate few, if any, jobs for the folks Trump has whipped up into a xenophobic frenzy. \r\n\r\nThen lets take the deportation and just focus on the big stuff. How exactly do you round up and deport 11 million people? Is he going to use stadiums and nationalize cruise ship lines? Who will be doing the rounding up, certainly not the police, the army perhaps? The children left behind? How about the fact that American farms, restaurants, not to mention landscaping and construction labor jobs will go unattended? Vital jobs for sure, but are these the jobs that Trump plans to provide for his real Americans to make America great again?\r\n\r\n5. Words matter.\r\n\r\nEverything is not a disaster, stupid or a disgrace. Neither is it tremendous, huge, fantastic or amazing. Everyone is not a loser, low energy or a bimbo. Talk of former presidents being liars ? or his favorite, a disaster ? and foreign dictators being great leaders does not advance the discourse. \r\n\r\nAmericans are mostly not prudes, but vulgarity from the dais, penis size allusions, reveling in sexual conquests, menstruation-based criticism and crass insults of every shape and form just does not cut it from a president. We have children.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Reading is good. So is studying.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump recently told us that he does not read much. We know from the recent revelations by Tony Schwartz, his ghost writer on The Art of the Deal (yes, I do have my copy from when it first came out, autographed with Donald telling me to keep up the great work), which Donald says is second only to the Bible as the must-read book, that he certainly has not written a book ? at least not that one.\r\n\r\nIt is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job.\r\nEven though for many years I owned a bookstore and would not let my kids watch TV on weekdays to help them become readers, I do not believe you must read to lead. I do believe, however, that those who seek to lead us need to study hard, seek to gain wisdom from others, and try to master very complex ideas and relationships. I think being president is hard. I am glad that after a long day, President Obama retreats to his private study almost every night for 3 or 4 hours of quiet study... and reading. \r\n\r\nAny fair interpretation of Trumps many bizarre statements and flip-flops makes it clear he has not the slightest inclination to read or study. In his own words, he makes decisions with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I already had, plus the words common sense, because I have lots of common sense and I have a lot of business ability. It is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job. \r\n\r\n7. The new vocabulary we are adjusting to is not a good one.\r\n\r\nXenophobe (intense dislike or fear of people from foreign countries); misogynist (strong prejudice against women); nativist (preference for established inhabitants as opposed to immigrants); fascist (authoritarian and dictatorial); bigot (intolerance for those with a different opinion); demagogue (inflaming passions based on popular desires not on rationale arguments); dystopian (describing a place, typically totalitarian, where everything is unpleasant and squalid); racist (oh, you know what this one is). \r\n\r\nWe have all had to get the dictionary out to understand many of the not household terms that had to find their way into print to describe the unique phenomenon that is Donald Trump. The scary thing is that these strange words are at least close to the mark. What happened to statesmanlike, well-qualified, or even brilliant, as words we can use to describe people we want to elect to high office? Havent heard any of these associated with the Donald.\r\n\r\n8. We need to be careful with tough.\r\n\r\n\r\nDonald Trump said of a protester at one of his rallies, in the good old days they would have carried him out on a stretcher. His world reveres this brand of toughness. This toughness is not about the strength it takes to use restraint or to make really hard decisions. It is about punching that guy in the face, or at a minimum, saving face ? his. \r\n\r\nI will resist the temptation to belabor the nuclear codes point again, and rather just query do we really want a thin-skinned president who, as he suggested, if a government leader (Castro) was not on the tarmac to meet his plane, would turn around Air Force One and come home. Or one who when confronted with the fact that whether or not his careless re-tweet of a white supremacist-created Jewish star and dollar bill-backed attack of Hillary Clinton was anti-Semitic, cant even just give one of those non-apology-apologies, I am sorry if I offended anyone. A tough-guy who instead declares major newscasters stupid and sick and makes it all about the media who dare to criticize him, with never a word to David Duke and the ugly element high-fiving him and resending his initial offensive post. \r\n\r\nWhether or not the post was intended to even more firmly entrench this segment of support, Trump demonstrates his version of tough, one that glorifies his opinion and his being right over all else. Nowhere in his world can tough be humble, respectful, restrained or diplomatic.\r\n\r\n9. Success does matter.\r\n\r\nDonald Trumps business success is greatly exaggerated and his skills limited. Donald Trump is a great salesman and a showman/promoter in a league only with PT Barnum. This we can give him. He has also been very good at making his name a brand and selling its use. For a while, he had some pretty high TV ratings by telling out of work celebrities they were fired. However, even in his own playing field, ask any large New York real estate developer, of whichsurprise, surprisehe is not one, at least not as to large (14th in New York City on the latest list), and you will learn his successes are few. \r\n\r\nFour business bankruptcies (1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009), the Plaza Hotel, Trump Air, all three casinos (a couple times) the steaks, the water, Trump Centre in New Jersey that I worked on, Manhattans West Side rail yards (where buildings do bear his name as a consolation), the much-hyped $35,000 get-rich scheme Trump University ? all failures by any measure except of course to Donald, who has no regrets, whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThen there are basic business ethics: 3,500 lawsuits, the fact that he has penchant for not paying bills fully or on time, or that he calls himself the King of Debt ? a king made rich by running up debt, then renegotiating it. Is this the skill set we want for the president?\r\n\r\nEven with Trumps fabled net worth, always exaggerated by billions more than others calculate, one has to wonder if his true net worth wouldnt be just as much if he took his considerable inheritance from father Fred and just passively invested it. Well never know from Donald ? certainly not from those tax returns he wont release.\r\n\r\n10. We could not be the great country we are without the First Amendment, but our media may kill us.\r\n\r\nThe media is not Donalds enemy as he keeps announcing from the stage. It may be the enemy of the rest of us, however. It sure feels like it lately. The air time Donald gets, and his ability to phone in his rants (especially with the cable media) is nothing short of, to use one of his words, disgusting. \r\n\r\nDonald, who lives by polls and ratings, understands it is ratings and not news worthiness that dictates what is on the airwaves. Donald dominates almost every news cycle, simply by being more outrageous than anyone or anything else. The false equivalency created by point-counterpoint talking heads then makes over-the-top positions seem legitimate. It is reality TV writ large and it is very out of control.\r\n\r\n11. Temperament, demeanor and character are important.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, Donald represents the very worst in all of us, or at least many of us. He is all about continuous gratification. He is the petulant child who wants his way. He is the selfish teenager with no big picture yet. He is the spoiled young man of privilege with the right race and religion, education, good looks, and family fortune to succeed easily, and who looks down on others lacking in any of the above who do not.\r\n\r\nHe is the spoiled young man of privilege with the right race ... and family fortune to succeed easily and who looks down on others lacking in any of the above who do not.\r\nHe is a man who thinks it is okay to call someone fat or ugly or stupid or to make fun of a person with a disability. He is the collector of trophy wives and trophy properties, the guy who wins, or so he thinks, because he has the most toys. \r\n\r\n12. The emperor and his clothes.\r\n\r\nDonald says he knows more about the military than anyone else. Why? Because he went to an expensive prep school where they wore uniforms and sometimes marched? How about, I know more about ISIS than the generals. Please, can some real soldiers evaluate this?\r\n\r\nDonald says America never wins anymore. Compared to whom, and at what? No doubt we have problems. Democracy is messy. Witness the present campaign, and the long slow recovery from the 2008 recession has not included the middle class nearly enough. And, yes, trade in a world that is now fully connected and integrated is hard to figure out. But by what measure is America, as Donald tells us, a disaster?\r\n\r\nHow do you actually say and believe, This country is a hell-hole. We are going down fast. Compared to whom? Mexico, China or his most bizarre new favorite, Russia, that he tells us beat us all the time ... because our leaders are stupid? Give us a break. \r\n\r\n13. Sophomoric speech tricks dont work ? at least not with most of us.\r\n\r\nSays Donald, I am not going to talk about the libertarian VP candidates alcoholism. I refuse to say... I cannot stand to say... that I cannot stand the sound of Clinton screaming into the microphone all the time. You just did, Donald. We get it that with these statements, even you know you are on shaky ground so you are trying to play it both ways. Doesnt work. Nor does your even more insidious, not-so-clever trick of attributing to others wild accusations that even you are afraid to make, but that you want to advance. \r\n\r\nHow about when discussing the Orlando massacre, there are a lot of people that think [President Obama] doesnt want to get it. A lot of people think maybe he doesnt want to know about it I happen to think he just doesnt know what he is doing, but there are many people that think maybe he just doesnt want to get it. He doesnt want to see whats really happening. And that could be. \r\n\r\nWho are these people who have placed the president on the side of the terrorists? Perhaps the same people who, with Trump, saw the masses in New Jersey celebrating the destruction of the twin towers, or those convinced Hillary Clinton murdered Vince Foster, that Ted Cruzs father was working with Lee Harvey Oswald to kill President Kennedy, or that President Obama was not born in the United States nor did he graduate from Harvard or Columbia. \r\n\r\nTwo possibilities. The likely one: lots of people are saying is just Trump code for I want to now float something so outrageous even red-faced Donald cant get it out without this qualifier. Or perhaps the lots of people is a select group, the closed loop of the loyalists who attend his rallies that heard it from him! \r\n\r\n14. A thin skin does not work for a president.\r\n\r\nThe politicians have again chosen this presidential pigmy as their nominee. So said the long-defunct New York Herald about Abraham Lincoln, now nearly everybodys choice for our nations best president. Consider the statement when George Washington left office: the time is now arrived for the source of all misfortune of our country [to be] reduced to a level with his fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nU.S. presidents, all of them, have had their critics, and in our land of wonderful free speech, the critics get to have their say. Thank goodness. That Donald does not do well with criticism is not really open to debate. Ask Megyn Kelly (third-rate talent), Rosie ODonnell (nice little fat Rosie, total loser) or Elizabeth Warren (Pocahontas) or for that matter virtually any of his recently vanquished adversaries: Cruz, Kasich, Rubio or Bush, in just the first tier. Even the one most like him (now apparently looking for a post-New Jersey job with him), Chris Christie felt his sting when he suggested Donald was thin-skinned. He just cant let anything go ever. He obsesses even when he wins. \r\n\r\nRepublicans who broke the pledge to support him, they should not be allowed to run for office again. In Donalds world, disagreeing with him has to have a consequence ? a serious one ? and pursuing this goal is worthy of effort and energy, even when it makes no difference. \r\n\r\nDo we really think our president has time for this? Do we really want a man with such sensibilities and such an authoritarian bent in charge of, say, the FBI or the IRS? Does the concept of secret police, a favorite of leaders of this type elsewhere, seem too extreme? Probably, yes. But if I was Donald, I would float it with one of his people are saying declarations. There, I just used his trick. See how easy it is. \r\n\r\n15. Bullies will always exist somewhere, but the White House should not be that somewhere.\r\n\r\nWhat does a bully do? Most of all he or she seeks to intimidate, physically or at least verbally. So far this character trait of Donalds has been exclusively verbal and aimed at business adversaries and more recently politicians and journalists ? and, of course, then ex-ghost writer of his book and ex-employees or contractors he cheated (those who do not have anti-disparagement contractual handcuffs) who dare to candidly assess his conduct. \r\n\r\nWhat happens when this guy gets the worlds strongest army at his disposal, and a bully pulpit that guarantees him notice? Seem like a bad idea to anyone else?\r\n\r\n16. Law and order.\r\n\r\nBefore it was an Emmy-winning TV show, law and order was a campaign theme used by Richard Nixon in 1968 to get himself elected in a year when our country had two very public assassinations and destructive demonstrations, even riots, in 110 U.S. cities. Nixon sought to mobilize what he called the silent majority around the need for more police. He also tapped into the racial and economic divide between black and white and working class and elite Eastern liberals, and the evil media that his vice president, Spiro Agnew, called nattering nabobs of negativism. Is Donald Trump seeking to bring this back? Of course yes, yet no.\r\n\r\nYes, he wants to separate and mobilize angry voters who feel left behind by an increasingly diverse culture. No, because his dystopian version of lawless, besieged, pitifully weak America is not what Nixon preached, nor for that matter Ronald Reagan. It is unique to him, at least in our country. It is, however, a textbook version of the rallying cry of countless dictators and strongmen. It is a demagogues basic tool, to gin up a problem then declare he is the only one who can fix it. \r\n\r\nAs bad as all this rhetoric is, what next? He tells us, On January 20, 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced... crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon?I mean very soon?come to an end. Hows this work, Donald? Martial law? Does he honestly believe President Obama, and for that matter all of his 44 predecessors, would not have liked to have all laws effective and fully followed? If only wishing could make it so! However, since the states, not the federal government, hold sway over most criminal law, the president acting alone has no Constitutional power to do any such thing. What then? More of the water boarding and killing families of terrorists logic? I alone can fix it!\r\n\r\n17. Incoherent rants, often contradictory, does not a foreign policy make.\r\n\r\nConvince Japan and South Korea to seek nuclear arms. Eliminate NATO. Crush ISIS but do it without Muslim allies and no troops on the ground. Sometimes attack Libya, sometimes not. Sometimes attack surgically, but dont let it come out the way it did. Sometimes its good we attacked Iraq, sometimes not. Do not nation build, but fix Syria. Stop Iran by making better deals. \r\n\r\nIn fact, come to think of it, that is the solution to almost everything: just make better deals everywhere. Oh, yes and never apologize for anything. We are America, very, very rich and beholden to no one. Like us or else. Sound like someone we know? \r\n\r\n18. How will anyone effectively be president if we dont at least respect the office?\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s during an unpopular war, we all endured a president adorning himself with a flag pin and declaring anyone who did not agree with him (which include a heck of a lot of young people on campuses all across America, including me) somehow un-American. Although political opposition is as old as our nation, we begin to slide down the slope of dangerous disrespect when disagreement is replaced with vilification. \r\n\r\nThis Republican nominee for the presidency thinks it is okay to accuse a former president of his own party of intentionally going to war on false pretenses and the current President of being in conspiracy with Muslim terrorists. Any thoughtful American of either party or no party, of any political philosophy must see that this must stop. \r\n\r\nTruth, or at least a semblance of some, has to come back. Outrageous lies just have no place in meaningful discourse ? outrageous liars even less so. They cannot become the backbone of a point-counterpoint talking-head media circus that is so much more about ratings than truth.\r\n\r\n19. Rich and powerful guys have to play by the rules, too.\r\n\r\nLets not kid ourselves. Trump University was not an academic institution, far from it. It was a get-rich-quick scheme by a guy selling a get-rich-quick scheme. It is not the first or the last of its type. Late night, cheap-advertising-time-television will always feature this fare. Donalds efforts, however, were on so much a grander scale ? $35,000... a university. Really? What this was is an out-and-out fraud scheme by a man now trying to become the leader of our country and the free world. \r\n\r\nWe all know, or at least have read, that suckers are born every minute. But cant we at least disrespect those who prey on these poor folks, and when they really go too far, sue them? No, says Donald Trump. The court case brought by a whole class of plaintiffs against his scam is only still in court, Donald says, because the long-time and distinguished federal judge is a hater not capable of giving him justice because his parents are from Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn Donalds world, the only individual capable of judging him would not be Mexican or related to anyone from Mexico, likewise folks of the Muslim faith, and, oh yeah, likewise women. In this world rich, entitled, egotistical, ethically-challenged older white men should then only be judged by rich, entitled, egotistical, ethically-challenged older white men.\r\n\r\n20. We must stand for something.\r\n\r\nDonald Trumps version of America does not include folks not like him. Instead, he is all about what Sarah Palin labeled real Americans. The fact that all us others seem to be utterly expendable is deeply troubling. Targeting an entire religion ? Islam, with 1.6 billion adherents, 3.3 million being U.S. citizens ? for extra scrutiny or worse is patently inconsistent with traditional American values, if not those of the real Americans.\r\n\r\nIt is also unconstitutional, and, beyond all this, incredibly counterproductive as it hardens the lines of controversy by wholesale moving of the allies we need to solve terrorist problems into the enemy camp. Other similar strategies championed by Donald, like waterboarding and other forms of torture, not to mention targeting families of an enemy, are not just illegal. They are, to use another one of his words, stupid. They do not work, very likely making situations worse and our enemies more numerous and passionate.\r\n\r\nOne has to wonder, what does the America of the real Americans look like? A bunch of intolerant, hyper aggressive, folks behind a big wall, isolated (not trading with anyone and thus with a sick economy and very expensive goods) and with a lot of enemies. No Shining City on the Hill, for sure. Hard to see anything but ruin ahead for such a place.\r\n\r\nWe can do so much better! For me, better comes easily in the form of former Senator and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. For those who do not come to that conclusion easily (I get it), this year it will have to be the lesser of two evils. No matter what, dont even think about taking us into the abyss that is Donald Trump. ",

    "text": "This is my last column until after the election, so Id like to address the people least likely to read it: Donald Trump voters. Who knows? Maybe Ill get lucky and a few of them will buy fish wrapped in this column, and theyll accidentally peruse it! Desperate times call for desperate measures.\r\n\r\nWhile Ive opposed the Trump candidacy from the start, Ive never disparaged Trump voters. Some are friends and neighbors; theyre all fellow Americans. We should take their concerns seriously. But we should also demand that they be serious, that they draw distinctions between these two presidential candidates.\r\n\r\nYes, Hillary Clinton is a flawed leader  but in the way so many presidents were. We know her flaws: She has a weakness for secrecy, occasionally fudges truths, has fawning aides and a husband who lacks discipline when it comes to moneymaking and women. But she is not indecent, and that is an important distinction. And shes studious, has sought out people of substance on every issue and has taken the job of running for president seriously.\r\n\r\nTrump is not only a flawed politician, hes an indecent human being. Hes boasted of assaulting women  prompting 11 to come forward to testify that he did just that to them; his defense is that he could not have assaulted these women because they werent pretty enough.\r\n\r\nHes created a university that was charged with defrauding its students. Hes been charged with discriminating against racial minorities in his rental properties. Hes stiffed countless vendors, from piano sellers to major contractors. Hes refused to disclose his tax returns because they likely reveal that hes paid no federal taxes for years, is in bed with dodgy financiers and doesnt give like he says to charity.\r\n\r\nHes compared the sacrifice of parents of a soldier killed in Iraq to his sacrifice of building tall buildings. Hes vowed, if elected, to prosecute his campaign rival.\r\n\r\nWe have never seen such behaviors in a presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Trump has shown no ability to talk about any policy issue with any depth. Harlan Cobens debate-night tweet last month had it right: On Aleppo he sounds like a fifth grader giving a book report on a book he never read.\r\n\r\nI understand why many Trump supporters have lost faith in Washington and want to just shake things up. When you shake things up with a studied plan and a clear idea of where you want to get to, you can open new futures. But when you shake things up, guided by one-liners and no moral compass, you can cause enormous instability and systemic vertigo.\r\n\r\nReceive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\r\n\r\nPRIVACY POLICY\r\nBut there is an even more important reason Trump supporters, particularly less-educated white males, should be wary of his bluster: His policies wont help them. Trump promises to bring their jobs back. But most of their jobs didnt go to a Mexican. They went to a microchip.\r\n\r\nThe idea that large numbers of manual factory jobs can be returned to America if we put up a wall with Mexico or renegotiate our trade deals is a fantasy. Trump ignores the fact that manufacturing is still by far the largest sector of the U.S. economy. Indeed, our factories now produce twice what they did in 1984  but with one-third fewer workers.\r\n\r\nTrump cant change that. Machines and software will keep devouring, and spawning, more work of all kinds. Did you hear that IBMs cognitive computer, Watson, helped to create a pop song, Not Easy, with the Grammy-winning producer Alex da Kid? The song was released on Oct. 21, IBM noted, and within 48 hours it climbed to No. 4 on iTuness Hot Tracks.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for certain how we deal with this new race with and against machines, but I can assure you its not Trumps way  build walls, restrict trade, give huge tax cuts to the rich. The best jobs in the future are going to be what I call STEMpathy jobs  jobs that blend STEM skills (science, technology, engineering, math) with human empathy. We dont know what many of them will look like yet.\r\n\r\nThe smartest thing we can do now is to keep our economy as open and flexible as possible  to get the change signals first and be able to quickly adapt; create the opportunity for every American to engage in lifelong learning, because whatever jobs emerge will require more knowledge; make sure that learning stresses as much of the humanities and human interactive skills as hard sciences; make sure we have an immigration policy that continues to attract the worlds most imaginative risk-takers; and strengthen our safety nets, because this era will leave more people behind.\r\n\r\nThis is the only true path to American greatness in the 21st century. Trump wants to make America great in ways that are just not available anymore. What do we have to lose by trying his way? Trump asks. The answer is: everything that actually makes us great. When the world gets this fast, small errors in navigation have huge consequences.\r\n\r\nWhile Clinton has failed to inspire, her instincts and ideas will keep us hewing to basically the right course. And however great her flaws, she is still in the zone of human decency. Trump is not.\r\n\r\nWe can never be great as a country with a president with the warped values of Donald Trump. I pray that in the end at least some Trump voters, my fellow Americans, will see that.",

    "text": "A bombshell study released by Stanford University confirms evidence of election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Party primaries. \r\n\r\nAccording to a paper released this week entitled, Are we witnessing a dishonest election?, a state comparison based on the voting procedures used during the election reveals endemic election fraud within the system.\r\n\r\nGiven the stakes in the outcome of the American presidential elections, ensuring the integrity of the electoral process is of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\nAre the results we are witnessing in the 2016 primary elections trustworthy? While Donald Trump enjoyed a clear and early edge over his Republican rivals, the Democratic contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernard Sanders has been far more competitive.\r\n\r\nAt present, Secretary Clinton enjoys an apparent advantage over Sanders. Is this claimed advantage legitimate?\r\n\r\nWe contend that it is not, and suggest an explanation for the advantage: States that are at risk for election fraud in 2016 systematically and overwhelmingly favor Secretary Clinton. We provide converging evidence for this claim.\r\n\r\nFirst, we show that it is possible to detect irregularities in the 2016 Democratic Primaries by comparing the states that have hard paper evidence of all the placed votes to states that do not have this hard paper evidence. Second, we compare the final results in 2016 to the discrepant exit polls.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we show that no such irregularities occurred in the 2008 competitive election cycle involving Secretary Clinton against President Obama.\r\n\r\nAs such, we find that in states wherein voting fraud has the highest potential to occur, systematic efforts may have taken place to provide Secretary Clinton with an exaggerated margin of support.",

    "text": "Another long-time lover of Bill Clinton has come forth, with a new book, Hillary, The Other Woman (WND Books), spilling beans on his insatiable satyriasis and Hillarys hell-bent political ambitions.\r\n\r\nShe is Dolly Kyle, an attorney in her 60s, who first met Bill Clinton in Arkansas in the summer of 1959 when she was 11 years old and he 12. Supposedly, it was love at first sight  a sexual relationship that lasted 32 years  through high school (although she says they didnt have sex until after graduation), Bills law school at Yale, his years as Arkansas governor, and until his entrance into the White House.\r\n\r\nDolly Kyle in 1998\r\n\r\nDolly Kyle in 1998\r\n\r\nThis is what Dolly Kyle wrote in her book (source: Daily Mail):\r\n\r\n(1) In 1987, Bill Clinton had had 2,000 sex partners:\r\n\r\nDolly said she started sleeping with Bill after high school and admits Billy was a sex addict; I was a codependent. In 1987, Bill Clinton was undone by Wilt Chamberlains claim to have slept with 20,000 women. Bill told Dolly, Thats ten times more than Ive had!  which meant Bill had sex with 2,000 women in 1987, which means that the number would be even higher by 2016.\r\n\r\nHey, Dolly Kyle, thats some love Bill Clinton had for you!\r\n\r\n(2) Bill Clinton had wanted to be president since high school:\r\n\r\nBill first confessed his desire to be president to Dolly back in high school, and began actively pursuing it after the summer of 1963 when, as an Arkansas delegate to Boys Nation, he had a photo-op with President John F Kennedy in the Rose Garden.\r\n\r\n(3) Bill Clinton called blacks niggers:\r\n\r\nDolly wrote that she frequently had heard Bill refer to blacks in the South as G**damn n****r.\r\n\r\n(4) Bill Clinton never used a condom, but seemingly was unconcerned because, as he told Dolly, he had a low sperm count. (Note: Other reports say Bill Clinton is sterile from mumps.)\r\n\r\n(5) It was a marriage of convenience  of Bill and Hillary using each other:\r\n\r\nHillarys role was financial provider to get Bill elected president, and pursue his addictions to politics, power and sex. Bills mother, too, had supported the family financially while his stepfather drank. Dolly wrote: Hillarys role of providing financial security for Billy was part of her motivation for the series of financial crimes (yes, crimes) that she committed over the decades. Hillary was upholding her part of the deal to get Billy elected president, after which it would be her turn to be the first woman in the Oval Office.\r\n\r\n(6) Bill Clinton called Hillary his warden:\r\n\r\nHillary kept Bills nose clean in the public mind and had private investigators tracking Bill and the women he was dating or attacking because she was riding his coattails to political power. Dolly writes: Hillary needs the power and she is ruthless.\r\n\r\nCollege-age Hillary Clinton \r\n\r\nCollege-age Hillary Clinton\r\n\r\n(7) Hillary was sweaty and had hairy calves and toes:\r\n\r\nDolly first met Hillary on the evening of May 28, 1974 at the airport in Little Rock. It was election night and Senator William Fulbright was running for re-election. Fulright was Bill Clintons champion  giving Bill his first Senate job while Bill attended Georgetown University; supporting him for the Rhodes Scholarship and a teaching job at Arkansas Law School; introducing him to powerful people in Washington and financial backers for Bills first congressional campaign that he eventually lost.\r\n\r\nDolly describes Hillary as a dowdy-looking woman who appeared to be middle-aged with thick eyebrows melded together stretching across her forehead, wearing coke-bottle-thick lenses and a misshapen, brown, dress-like thing that must have been intended to hide her lumpy body. The garment was long, but stopped too soon to hide her fat ankles and her thick calves covered with black hair. Thick brown sandals did nothing to conceal her wide feet and the hair on her toes.\r\n\r\nHillary glared at Dolly with hostility. Dolly writes: In that moment, I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldnt gag when she got in the car. When Bill introduced the dowdy woman as Hillary, Dolly was stunned and thought it was some kind of a sick joke  a woman in a hideous disguise.\r\n\r\n(8) Bill discarded his mentor-benefactor Sen. Fulbright when the latter lost reelection:\r\n\r\nDolly writes that although the plan had been to go the Fulbrights campaign headquarters, when the votes came in showing he was losing, Hillary signaled to Bill and the plan was changed. He would head back to the airport. Bill told Dolly, I dont want to be seen with a loser.\r\n\r\n(9) Hillarys attempt to carve a political career for herself in Washington sizzled:\r\n\r\nA lawyer and graduate of Yale, Hillary wanted a career in Washington but she flunked the DC bar exam. Dolly writes that at the time of her meeting Hillary for the first time, Hillary was working in Washington, DC and trying to become a political force under her own steam. But It was a futile attempt and Hillarys job with the Watergate investigation ended. Dolly believes Hillary showed the same lack of integrity there that would later get her into more serious trouble. (See Hillary Clinton was fired for lying when she was 27 years old)\r\n\r\n(10) Hillary was a lesbian:\r\n\r\nAlthough Bill did not use the word lesbian, he hinted at it by keep referring to Hillarys lifestyle.\r\n\r\nIn March 1979, Bill told Dolly he wanted a child but had a low sperm count: We need to have a baby so we can appear to be a normal couple. We need to do something serious to take attention off the Wardens lifestyle. He asked Dolly to pray for a baby. Dolly suggested he had to bite the bullet and sleep with Hillary. Within a year, Chelsea Victoria Clinton was born and Bill fell head over heels with the little baby. (See Bill Clinton not Chelseas biological father)\r\n\r\nChelsea Clinton (l) and Wester Hubbell\r\n\r\nChelsea Clinton (l) and Wester Hubbell\r\n\r\nBut Hillary felt trapped being at home with a baby and couldnt wait to get back to work. She asked her friend, Louise: How long do I have to stay at home with this kid? Hillary stayed home with baby Chelsea for three months before returning to work. Bill told to Dolly that it was the baby that kept the couple together.\r\n\r\n(11) Hillarys other attractive qualities:\r\n\r\nHillary resented that she had to dress like Southern women; she visited dress shops but generally didnt buy anything. Dolly also confirms Secret Service agents accounts of Hillarys foul mouth, anger towards the White House and Arkansas governor security detail, and physical abuse of Bill. In Arkansas, she had hissy fits and threw dishes at Bill in the kitchen, breaking a kitchen cabinet door. When Bill lost the governorship after one year, Hillary was furious, knowing that she was no longer the states First Lady and had to move out of the governors mansion and into a tiny house. (See Ex-Secret Service agent: Jekyll & Hyde personality makes Hillary unfit to be President)\r\n\r\nDolly writes: Hillary is not a leader. She is a coattail-clutcher who has a litany of jobs with no accomplishments, having failed as co-president, failed as senator unless you are impressed with the bills she introduced to name a couple of post offices, failed as secretary of state and as a defender of women over the past 40 years. Hillary instigated threats on women who had sex with her husband, a serial sex abuser.\r\n\r\n(12) Dollys summary opinion of the Clintons:\r\n\r\nDespite her long, 32-year sexual (its true love!) relationship with Bill Clinton, Dolly Kyle has only contempt for the Clintons. She writes:\r\n\r\nBilly and Hillary Clinton continue to be lying, cheating, manipulative, scratching, clawing, ruthlessly aggressive, insatiably ambitious politicians who are giving public service a bad name  and nothing about them has changed in the past forty-plus years, except that they have deluded more and more people. The Clintons and their misled supporters have rewritten history to suit their political agenda, which is to get votes to get power to get money to get more power to get more money. The Clintons vicious cycle of intertwining greed and power addictions will have no limit, unless someone stands up and announces. The emperor has no clothes! Ideology, integrity, and love of country were never involved in the Billary quest for the White House. It was always a codependent, co-conspiratorial grab for money and power and more money and more power. Unfortunately for them and for the United States of America, there is never enough to satisfy addicts.",

This comes as to shock to those who thought that Sauron was destroyed at the end of the Third Age.\r\n\r\nThough Saurons power greatly diminished after the destruction of The One Ring, a fragment of his broken spirit has endured for millennia, and still lurks beneath the ruins of Barad-dr (present-day Gadsden, Alabama). The Dark Lord is currently not powerful enough to assume a physical form, but still has the presence of mind to follow the Republican presidential primaries.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump is the only candidate who can fulfill my vision for the future, Sauron said Saturday night in an omnipresent, ethereal whisper. Just as I spread darkness and suffering across Middle-Earth, so shall Trump bring darkness to Middle America.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, Trump is a natural choice for Sauron. During his tenure as the Dark Lord of Mordor, Sauron enacted or supported numerous controversial policies, including the expansion of torture, the murder of Rohirrim families, and the deportation of 12 million dwarves.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about Sauron on NBCs Meet the Press, Trump seemed hesitant to distance himself from the evil necromancer. I dont think the American people want me to dismiss every Dark Lord before I have a chance to learn more about them, said Trump. I just dont know anything about Sauron or his dark legion of orcs, trolls, and Nazgl; I need to do more research.\r\n\r\nTrumps refusal to disavow Saurons support has sparked huge backlash from pundits and fellow presidential candidates, who claim that Trump is himself a lieutenant of the Dark Lord. The Republican frontrunner took to Twitter to refute this claim: Definitely not a follower of Sauron.

Id like them to know that wed love to see them consider moving over here.\r\n\r\nOur big concern is employment and trying to encourage families to move over here because the population is declining. The island featured on an Irish TV documentary last year which gave us great publicity and a good few extra bookings. But we ended up having a terrible summer and a lot of people canceled.\r\n\r\nTheyd be given a huge welcome and theyd find this is a fantastic place to live and to bring up children. Their kids would probably get the best education anywhere in the country too, because the teacher to pupil ratio is nearly one-on-one.\r\n\r\nAlthough winters can be hard and its the kind of life that wouldnt necessarily suit everyone, theyd find it very peaceful here and theyd soon find out theres nowhere as nice in the world on a summers day than here.\r\n\r\nThe website IrishCentral.com also got in on the action recently, by publishing their own guide on moving to Ireland in case Donald Trump is elected.\r\n\r\nThe website describes the details, and realities, of moving to Ireland. It isnt particularly cheap and the financial restrictions on it might preclude some people from being able to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some big things on the plus side. The gun laws are restrictive and you wont see wannabe cowboys carrying handguns openly in Ireland  a huge plus. They have strong social welfare and services, plus did I mention universal heathcare? Not exactly a terrible idea  They also do take some well-placed digs at our Republican problem, by making a few short jabs at the likes of Bill OReilly and Donald Trump in particular, by stressing that you request an absentee ballot so you can still vote against Donald Trump for a nice middle finger from across the pond.\r\n\r\nMore than likely, Trump will not get elected.

But theres no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and hes willing to expose Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nNow, hes announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria.\r\n\r\nClinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nWikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested:\r\n\r\nThe Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua.\r\nSounds familiar?\r\n\r\nIn Obamas second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.\r\n\r\nClinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called Friends of Syria (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS) to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria.\r\n\r\nUnder oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with Democracy Now, Wikileaks Julian Assange is now stating that 1,700 emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS.\r\nVia The Duran\r\n\r\nHere is the incredible transcript:\r\n\r\nJUAN GONZLEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clintons private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and whats the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base?\r\nJULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesnt exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And its gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some caseor contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We cant possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand.\r\n\r\nSo, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, thats there in those emails. Theres more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clintons collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.",

All across the country Sanders core infrastructure of volunteers and paid staff are mobilizing to collect signatures and perform necessary paperwork to get him on the general election ballots in the states.\r\n\r\nOfficials highly placed within the Sanders campaign remain evasive and deny that the senator plans, at this time, to run as an independent. Sanders campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, has stated time and time again that they intend to go all the way to the convention and make the case that Sanders should be the Democratic nominee for the 2016 general election. But the Sanders campaign is actively engaging in activities, within the states, that have no other purpose besides putting Sanders in the position of being able to run as an independent candidate against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nIf Sanders were to run in the general election, as the evidence of his campaigns actions point to, it could disastrously impact Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clintons ability to win against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. With present polling showing Clinton ahead of Trump in the general election by only six points, even a small split of democratic/democratic leaning independent voters would virtually guarantee a Trump victory and presidency. And with divisiveness and disunity within the Democratic party over policy direction and candidate choice at an all time high, polling experts say Sanders could syphon off as much as 20% of the democratic vote in a 3 candidate general election.\r\n\r\nMany of Sanders supporters have been openly and vocally calling for the senator to run as an independent if he fails to secure the Democratic nomination. Citing unfair favouritism toward Clinton by the DNC under Debbie Wasserman Schultz, highly suspicious deviations between primary exit polling and election results, Sanders supporters have made the argument that the systematic corruption within the Democratic party will not allow progressive ideas and platforms to flourish if the party elite believe they can act with impunity and still count on the vote of progressives. It has been reported that Sanders is privately supportive of this type of analysis, and his coming independent candidacy will be engineered to force the party to the left, going forward, if they wish to compete against Republicans on a national level.\r\n\r\nSources within the Sanders campaign, speaking on conditions of anonymity, say that Sanders has indeed been seriously considering an independent run, and wishes to ensure the option is available to him by performing the necessary work now. If Sanders were to wait until after the convention to lay the legal foundation for an independent run it would be too late. It is this fact that explains the Sanders campaigns actions toward inclusion on state ballots as an independent at this time.",

We said no to black, because that sounded too polarizing. In the end, we went with negro. Its historically accurate. Nothing racist about it.\r\n\r\nNot everything is about race, added the spokesman. We hope Stacey Dash will make that fact clear to you people once and for all.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: OMAROSA WILL NOT WORK WITH STACEY DASH",

    "text": "Home  News  Putin: Hacked Emails Reveal That Clinton Threatened Sanders Wife\r\nPutin: Hacked Emails Reveal That Clinton Threatened Sanders Wife\r\nPosted on July 29, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry in News, US // 0 Comments\r\nThe Kremlin claim the Clinton campaign \r\n   \r\nKremlin sources say the Clinton campaign sent their goons to give Jane Sanders the shakedown, in order to end the Bernie Sanders campaign before the convention, citing evidence from one of 10,000 Hillary emails Putin has in his personal possession. \r\n\r\nThe Clinton campaign needed Bernie Sanders on board before the emails were leaked as they contained evidence that confirmed his suggestions of Democratic establishment bias and would have given him unstoppable momentum heading into the convention  had he chosen to play that game.\r\n\r\nThe Kremlin have threatened to release 20,000 emails that Russia have hacked from Hilary Clinton's email server.\r\nKremlin To Release 20,000 Hacked Hillary Clinton Emails\r\n\r\nHowever after the meeting with the Clinton team Sanders unexpectedly suspended his previously gung-ho campaign, and although he refused to wholeheartedly endorse her, he signalled to his supporters that his run for President was effectively over.\r\n\r\nKremlin sources have denied the DNC claims that Russian state-sponsored hackers are behind the email leaks, with Julian Assange also stating the DNC claim is a politically motivated lame conspiracy smear.\r\n\r\nDespite the FBI asking the Kremlin for copies of any emails they have in their possession, it is understood the Kremlin has not released anything to anyone, including Wikileaks.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kremlin sources, the source of the Wikileaks email trove could have come from a huge number of possible sources, as intelligence communities around the whole world have copies of Hillarys emails. Everybody is talking about them.\r\n\r\nSenior staff in the Kremlin have been allowed to see the emails, however Putin alone has access to them and keeps them on his personal laptop, under lock and key. He has been heard staying up until 2am, reading their contents out loud, roaring with laughter.\r\n\r\nPresident Vladimir Putin is said to be amused by Democratic Party attempts to portray him as the villain, when their own failings are on display for all to see. They always need a babayka [boogeyman] to frighten people with. I am the Eastern boogeyman, it seems.\r\n\r\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump reached out to the Kremlin, promising them rewards if they release Hillary Clintons missing emails.\r\n\r\nRussia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing, Trump said on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Lets see if that happens. That will be next.\r\n\r\nPresident Vladimir Putins spokesman, while not directly denying Russian involvement in the hack, said Moscow would never interfere in another countrys election.\r\n\r\nPresident Putin more than once has said that Russia would never interfere and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, especially in the electoral process, Dmitry Peskov told journalists Wednesday in a conference call.\r\n\r\nPeskov also criticized the willingness to accuse Russia of wrongdoing. If we talk about some sort of suspicions against a country, then it is necessary at a minimum to be precise and concrete, the spokesman said.\r\n\r\nHe said speculation in this case does not show a constructive attitude.",

President John Ashe had many wondering whether foul play was involved.\r\n\r\nThe New York Posts Page Six reported that after Ashe was found dead Wednesday, the U.N. claimed that he had died from a heart attack. Local police officers in Dobbs Ferry, New York, later disputed that claim, saying instead that he died from a workout accident that crushed his throat.\r\n\r\nAdding to the mysterious nature of Ashes death was the fact that he had been slated to be in court Monday with his Chinese businessman co-defendant Ng Lap Seng, from whom he reportedly received over $1 billion in donations during his term as president of the U.N. General Assembly.\r\n\r\nAccording to an unidentified source who spoke with Page Six, prosecutors had intended to use the latter fact to link Ashe directly to Democrat front-runner Hillary Clinton, with whom he could be seen schmoozing in the picture above.\r\n\r\nIt would have been very embarrassing, the source added. His death was conveniently timed.\r\n\r\nThere was no evidence at the moment to corroborate the sources theory of foul play, but that certainly did not stop conspiracy theorists from theorizing about what really happened.\r\n\r\nThose theorists inclined to believe the stories about Hillary and Bill Clinton ordering the murders of their opponents wondered whether the former U.N. president was merely their latest victim\r\n\r\nHowever, Ashes own lawyer, Jeremy Schneider, strongly disagreed with these theories.\r\n\r\nTRENDING STORIES\r\n\r\nTrump Ditches Media, Walks Into Restaurant Tells Diners Hes Lowering Their Taxes, Gets Explosive Applause\r\nSHOCK: Insider Reveals Bill Blames Hillary for Loss Media Dumbfounded\r\nInsider Reveals Hillary Got So Violent After Losing Extreme Measures Had to Be Taken\r\nThere is not one iota of evidence that it was homicide, he reportedly said.

    "text": "atican City  In a final speech to the synod, Pope Francis endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, while taking some clear swipes at conservatives who hold up church doctrine above all else, and use it to cast judgment on others.\r\n\r\nThe synod experience also made us better realize that the true defenders are not those who uphold its letter, but its spirit; not ideas but people; not formulas but free availability of Gods love and forgiveness, Pope Francis said. I see in Senator Bernard Sanders a man of great integrity and moral conviction, who understands these principles and genuinely wants whats best for all people\r\n\r\nThe pope went on to criticize ultra-conservatives, saying church leaders should confront difficult issues fearlessly, without burying our heads in the sand. It was the latest in a series of admonitions to bishops by the pontiff, who has stressed since his election in 2013 that the 1.2 billion-member Church should be open to change, side with the poor, and rid itself of the arrogance and unfettered narcissism that has alienated so many Catholics in recent years.\r\n\r\nNaturally, conservative Catholics are not happy with Francis for being so outspoken on social issues and American politics. The pope needs to stick to religion, and stay the hell out of politics, says Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali. Conservative Catholics are losing faith in the Church, and this falls directly on the shoulders of Pope Francis with his socialist ideology and warped political views.\r\n\r\nConservative news outlets like Fox News have taken issue with Pope Francis on everything from climate change to income inequality. Bill OReilly has numerous times compared Pope Francis to Bernie Sanders, accusing both of being false prophets.\r\n\r\nLiberals and progressives on the other hand applaud the pope for bringing social and environmental issues to the forefront of the Catholic Church. Hes a Catholic rockstar, says Prudence Bradley, 19, from upstate New York. Pope Francis has made it cool to be a Christian again.",

    "text": "Khizr Khan, the Muslim Gold Star father that the mainstream media and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been using to criticize Donald J. Trump, has deep ties to the government of Saudi Arabiaand to international Islamist investors through his own law firm. In addition to those ties to the wealthy Islamist nation, Khan also has ties to controversial immigration programs that wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the United Statesand has deep ties to the Clinton Cash narrative through the Clinton Foundation.\r\nKhan and his wife Ghazala Khan both appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention to attack, on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons behalf, Donald Trumpthe Republican nominee for president. Their son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, was killed in Iraq in 2004. Khizr Khan, in his speech to the DNC, lambasted Donald Trump for wanting to temporarily halt Islamic migration to America from countries with a proven history of exporting terrorists.\r\n\r\nSince then, Clinton operative George Stephanopouloswho served as a senior adviser to the president in Bill Clintons White House and is a Clinton Foundation donor as well as a host on the ABC networkpushed Trump on the matter in an interview. Trumps comments in that interview have sparked the same mini-rebellion inside his party, in the media and across the aisle that has happened many times before. The usual suspects inside the GOP, from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to House Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, have condemned Trump in one way or another. The media condemnation has been swift and Democrats, as well their friends throughout media, are driving the train as fast as they can.\r\n\r\nBut until now, it looked like the Khans were just Gold Star parents who the big bad Donald Trump attacked. It turns out, however, in addition to being Gold Star parents, the Khans are financially and legally tied deeply to the industry of Muslim migrationand to the government of Saudi Arabia and to the Clintons themselves.\r\n\r\nKhan, according to Intelius as also reported by Walid Shoebat, used to work at the law firm Hogan Lovells, LLP, a major D.C. law firm that has been on retainer as the law firm representing the government of Saudi Arabia in the United States for years. Citing federal government disclosure forms, the Washington Free Beacon reported the connection between Saudi Arabia and Hogan Lovells a couple weeks ago.\r\n\r\nHogan Lovells LLP, another U.S. firm hired by the Saudis, is registered to work for the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia through 2016, disclosures show, Joe Schoffstall of the Free Beacon reported.\r\n\r\nThe federal form filed with the Department of Justice is a requirement under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, which makes lobbyists and lawyers working on behalf of foreign governments and other agents from abroad with interests in the United States register with the federal government.\r\n\r\nThe government of Saudi Arabia, of course, has donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given between $10 and $25 million to the foundation while Friends of Saudi Arabia has contributed between $1 and $5 million, Schoffstall wrote.\r\n\r\nTrump, of course, has called on Hillary Clinton to have the Clinton Foundation return the money.\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays, Trump wrote in a Facebook post back in June, according to Politico. Hillary must return all money from such countries!\r\n\r\nCrooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate, Trump posted in a separate Facebook posting at the time. I am calling on her to immediately return the $25 million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation!\r\n\r\nOf course, to this day, Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has kept the money from the Saudi Arabian government.\r\n\r\nSchoffstalls piece in the Washington Free Beacon also notes how Hogan Lovells lobbyist Robert Kyle, per Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, has bundled more than $50,000 in donations for Clintons campaign this year.\r\n\r\nKhans connections with the Hogan Lovells firm run deep, according to a report from Law.com written by Katelyn Polantz.\r\n\r\nMany lawyers at Hogan Lovells remember the week in 2004 when U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan lost his life to a suicide bomber, Polantz wrote. Then-Hogan & Hartson attorneys mourned the death because the soldiers father, Khizr Khan, a Muslim American immigrant, was among their beloved colleagues.\r\n\r\nPolantz wrote that Khan worked at the mega-D.C. law firm for years.\r\n\r\nKhan spent seven years, from 2000 to 2007, in the Washington, D.C., office of then-Hogan & Hartson, Polantz wrote. He served as the firms manager of litigation technology. Although he did not practice law while at Hogan, Khan was well versed in understanding the American courts system. On Thursday night, he described his late son dreaming of becoming a military lawyer.\r\n\r\nBut representing the Clinton Foundation backing Saudi Arabian government and having one of its lobbyists bundle $50,000-plus for Clintons campaign are hardly the only places where the Khan-connected Hogan Lovells D.C. mega-firm brush elbows with Clinton Cash. \r\n\r\nThe firm also handles Hillary Clintons taxes and is deeply connected with the email scandal whereby when she was Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton set up a home-brew email server system that jeopardized classified information handling and was extremely careless according to FBI director James Comey.\r\n\r\nA lawyer at Hogan & Hartson [Howard Topaz] has been Bill and Hillary Clintons go-to guy for tax advice since 2004, according to documents released Friday by Hillary Clintons campaign, The American Lawyers Nate Raymond wrote in 2008, as Hillary Clinton ran for president that year. The Clintons tax returns for 2000-07 show combined earnings of $109 million, on which they paid $33 million in taxes. New York-based tax partner Howard Topaz has a broad tax practice, and also regularly advises corporations on M&A and executive compensation.\r\n\r\nBreitbart News Patrick Howley, in a deep investigative piece on Hillary Clintons email scandal, late last year uncovered how Topazs firmwhich employed Khan while Topaz did Hillary Clintons taxesis also connected to the email scandal.\r\n\r\nTopaz was a partner at Hogan & Hartson, which later merged to become known as Hogan Lovells, where Topaz continues to practice. The firms lawyers were major donors to Hillary Clintons first presidential campaign, Howley wrote.\r\n\r\nFor her private email system, Clinton used a spam filtering program MX Logic.\r\n\r\nHogan & Hartson handled the patent for MX Logics email-filtering program, which McAfee bought the small company for $140 million in 2009 in order to acquire, Howley wrote. The MX Logic companys application for a trademark for its SPAMTRAQ program was filed in 2004 on Hogan & Hartson stationery and signed by a Hogan & Hartson attorney. Hogan & Hartson has been responsible for MX Logic annual reports. The email companys Clinton links present more evidence that Clintons political and legal establishment was monitoring her private email use.\r\n\r\nIf that all isnt enough, that same Hogan & Hartson law firmnow Hogan Lovellsemployed Loretta Lynch, the current Attorney General of the United States. Lynch infamously just a few weeks ago met with Bill Clinton, Hillarys husband and the former president, on her private jet in Phoenix just before clearing Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing when it came to her illicit private email server system.\r\n\r\nKhans own website for his own personal law firm KM Khan Law Office shows he represents clients in the business of buying visas to enter the United States. One of his specific areas of practice, according to the website, is E2 Treaty Investors, EB5 Investments & Related Immigration Services.\r\n\r\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the U.S. Senates Judiciary Committee, has detailed how the EB5 immigration program is riddled with flaws and corruption.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is only here on Capitol Hillon this island surrounded by realitythat we can choose to plug our ears and refuse to listen to commonly accepted facts, Grassley said in a statement earlier this year. The Government Accountability Office, the media, industry experts, members of congress, and federal agency officials, have concurred that the program is a serious problem with serious vulnerabilities. Allow me to mention a few of the flaws.\r\n\r\nFrom there, Sen. Grassley listed out several of the flaws with the EB5 immigration program that Khan works in:\r\n\r\n Investments can be spent before business plans are approved. \r\n\r\n Regional Center operators can charge exorbitant fees of foreign nationals in addition to their required investments.  \r\n\r\n Jobs created are not direct or verifiable jobs but rather are indirect and based on estimates and economic modeling.\r\n\r\n Jobs created by U.S. investors are counted by the foreign national when obtaining a green card, even if EB-5 money is only a fraction of the total invested.\r\n\r\n Investment funds are not adequately vetted. \r\n\r\n Gifts and loans are acceptable sources of funds from foreign nationals.\r\n\r\n The investment level has been stagnant for nearly 25 years.\r\n\r\n Theres no prohibition against foreign governments owning or operating regional centers or projects.\r\n\r\n Regional centers can be rented or sold without government oversight or approval.\r\n\r\n Regional centers dont have to certify that they comply with securities laws.  \r\n\r\n Theres no oversight of promoters who work overseas for the regional centers.\r\n\r\n Theres no set of sanctions for violations, no recourse for bad actors.\r\n\r\n There are no required background checks on anyone associated with a regional center.\r\n\r\n Regional centers draw Targeted Employment Area boundaries around poor areas in order to come in at a lower investment level, yet the jobs created are not actually created in those areas.\r\n\r\n Every Targeted Employment Area designation is rubberstamped by the agency.\r\n\r\n Adjudicators are pressured to get to a yes, especially for those politically connected. \r\n\r\n Visas are not properly scrutinized. \r\n\r\n Visas are pushed through despite security warnings.\r\n\r\n Files and applications lack basic and necessary information to monitor compliance.\r\n\r\n The agency does not do site visits for each and every project.\r\n\r\n Theres no transparency on how funds are spent, who is paid, and what investors are told about the projects they invest in.\r\n\r\nThats not to mention the fact that, according to Sen. Grassley, there have been serious national security violations in connection with the EB5 program that Khan works in and around already. In fact, the programaccording to Grassleywas used by Middle Eastern operatives from Iran to attempt to illicitly enter the United States.\r\n\r\nThere are also classified reports that detail the national security, fraud and abuse. Our committee has received numerous briefings and classified documents to show this side of the story, Grassley said in the early February 2016 statement. The enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security wrote an internal memo that raises significant concerns about the program. One section of the memo outlines concerns that it could be used by Iranian operatives to infiltrate the United States. The memo identifies seven main areas of program vulnerability, including the export of sensitive technology, economic espionage, use by foreign government agents and terrorists, investment fraud, illicit finance and money laundering.\r\n\r\nMaybe all of this is whyas Breitbart News has previously notedthe Democratic National Convention made absolutely no mention of the Clinton Foundation or Clinton Global Initiative. Hillary Clintons coronation ceremony spent exactly zero minutes of the four nights of official DNC programming talking about anything to do with perhaps one of the biggest parts of her biography. ",

According to Graham, who feels Trump has been chosen by God, the reality TV star was the only thing standing between Christians and death camps.\r\n\r\nThe liberal Democrats are openly hostile to Christians, said Graham in an interview on WEHW radio. We wont survive four more years of Democrat-led government. I can see them rounding Christians up and putting us in death camps unless we follow their laws that want to grant special rights to gays and transgender people.\r\n\r\nChristians need to vote for Trump, he embodies our values, said Graham.\r\n\r\nApparently, many Evangelical Christians feel they are under siege. FOX News commentator Bill OReilly has done several segments on the alleged War on Christmas.\r\n\r\nRight Wing Watch reported Carl Gallups, an End Times preacher, told World Net Daily that the U.S. government was currently at war with Christians.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this particular election is right up there with the presidential elections before and during the Civil War, said Gallups. We are in a kind of societal civil war right now! And we are certainly in a great spiritual civil war in our nation, perhaps one like never before.\r\n\r\nSharing is caring!",

Julie Newmar.\r\n\r\nThe artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time, and he says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman.\r\n\r\nI had just come out of the bathroom when Trump jumped on me and kissed me, he explained. He started grabbing my ass and pulled my dress up to grab my genitals. He suddenly became very angry. He started yelling and cursing, and he left the party.\r\n\r\n\r\nRupaul says he was dressed very sexy for the party and is convinced that Trump thought he was a woman.\r\nRupaul says he found Donald Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity.\r\n\r\nRupaul told the Hollywood Inquirer that Donald Trump moved on him during a party, grabbing his ass and genitals.\r\nHe just wanted to use me as an object, he told Hollywood Inquirer. Ive never felt so dirty in my life! In a way, I was saved by the fact that Im a man.\r\n\r\nThis allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nMany women have come forward over the last week to denounce the abusive groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which Trumpss alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered.\r\n\r\nAll these allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from 2005 obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News.\r\n\r\nThe comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show Access Hollywood.\r\n\r\nThe remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation.\r\n\r\nYou know Im automatically attracted to beautiful  I just start kissing them. Its like a magnet. Just kiss. I dont even wait, Trump said. And when youre a star they let you do it. You can do anything.\r\n\r\nHe added: Grab them by the pussy.

    "text": "PHOENIX A.Z. (AP)  For months now, rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Today a man from Trumps rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event.\r\n\r\nI was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trumps rally in Fountain Hills, said 37-year-old Paul Horner. I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.\r\n\r\nTrump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders campaign, but Horner disagrees.\r\n\r\nAs for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clintons campaign, Horner said. The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called Women Are The Future. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is. Horner continued, It was mostly women in their 60s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nCraigslist ad for Donald Trump protesters\r\nA screenshot of the Craigslist ad that Horner says he responded to. The actual ad has since been removed. (Dennis System, File) / ABC News\r\nI knew those werent real protesters, they were too organized and smart, said 59-year-old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch em and stuff. Downey continued, I think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommys house; I got a bunch of high-fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I dont think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid.\r\n\r\nIll protest that guy for free, Bradley said. Trump is creating a place for like-minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate-filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldnt have to pay me anything to protest that. Bradley continued, Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them.\r\n\r\nHorner said the group had a mandatory six-hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trumps rally.\r\n\r\nDuring training we were taught chants to shout like Dump Trump and Trump Is A Racist, things like that. We were told how to respond to anti-Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, Were just going to tunnel underneath it. They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said F*ck Donald Trump along with a sign to hold that said Make America White Again.\r\n\r\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\r\n\r\nYou have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the Silverback gorilla my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a child, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well, but thats just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thats it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Im only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us. Mikkelson continues, It is common for us to rewrite a story were debunking if we dont like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a persons name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We dont list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; Its just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, Id say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.\r\n\r\nABC News reached out to Hillary Clintons campaign for comment but did not receive a response.",

    "text": "A review of FBI Director James Comeys professional history and relationships shows that the Obama cabinet leader  now under fire for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton  is deeply entrenched in the big-money cronyism culture of Washington, D.C. His personal and professional relationships  all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton  reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe.\r\n\r\nThese concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, Comeys former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partners board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton Foundations taxes.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin\r\n\r\nWhen President Obama nominated Comey to become FBI director in 2013, Comey promised the United States Senate that he would recuse himself on all cases involving former employers.\r\n\r\nBut Comey earned $6 million in one year alone from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin became a Clinton Foundation donor that very year.\r\n\r\nComey served as deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft for two years of the Bush administration. When he left the Bush administration, he went directly to Lockheed Martin and became vice president, acting as a general counsel.\r\n\r\nHow much money did James Comey make from Lockheed Martin in his last year with the company, which he left in 2010? More than $6 million in compensation.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin is a Clinton Foundation donor. The company admitted to becoming a Clinton Global Initiative member in 2010.\r\n\r\nAccording to records, Lockheed Martin is also a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which paid Bill Clinton $250,000 to deliver a speech in 2010.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lockheed Martin won 17 approvals for private contracts from the Hillary Clinton State Department.\r\n\r\nHSBC Holdings\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Comey became a board member, a director, and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings.\r\n\r\nMr. Comeys appointment will be for an initial three-year term which, subject to re-election by shareholders, will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 Annual General Meeting, according to HSBC company records.\r\n\r\nHSBC Holdings and its various philanthropic branches routinely partner with the Clinton Foundation. For instance, HSBC Holdings has partnered with Deutsche Bank through the Clinton Foundation to retrofit 1,500 to 2,500 housing units, primarily in the low- to moderate-income sector in New York City.\r\n\r\nRetrofitting refers to a Green initiative to conserve energy in commercial housing units. Clinton Foundation records show that the Foundation projected $1 billion in financing for this Green initiative to conserve peoples energy in low-income housing units.\r\n\r\nWho Is Peter Comey?\r\n\r\nWhen our source called the Chinatown offices of D.C. law firm DLA Piper and asked for Peter Comey, a receptionist immediately put him through to Comeys direct line. But Peter Comey is not featured on the DLA Piper website.\r\n\r\nPeter Comey serves as Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas for DLA Piper. James Comey was not questioned about his relationship with Peter Comey in his confirmation hearing.\r\n\r\nDLA Piper is the firm that performed the independent audit of the Clinton Foundation in November during Clinton-Worlds first big push to put the email scandal behind them. DLA Pipers employees taken as a whole represent a major Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign donation bloc and Clinton Foundation donation base.\r\n\r\nDLA Piper ranks #5 on Hillary Clintons all-time career Top Contributors list, just ahead of Goldman Sachs.\r\n\r\nAnd here is another thing: Peter Comey has a mortgage on his house that is owned by his brother James Comey, the FBI director.\r\n\r\nPeter Comeys financial records, obtained by Breitbart News, show that he bought a $950,000 house in Vienna, Virginia, in June 2008. He needed a $712,500 mortgage from First Savings Mortgage Corporation.\r\n\r\nBut on January 31, 2011, James Comey and his wife stepped in to become Private Party lenders. They granted a mortgage on the house for $711,000. Financial records suggest that Peter Comey took out two such mortgages from his brother that day.\r\n\r\nThis financial relationship between the Comey brothers began prior to James Comeys nomination to become director of the FBI.\r\n\r\nDLA Piper did not answer any question as to whether James Comey and Peter Comey spoke at any point about this mortgage or anything else during the Clinton email investigation.",

Former first lady Nancy Reagan, who died on March 6 at the age of 94, remained mentally alert until the very end, according to a private nurse, who told reporters Mrs. Reagans last words to her were, Do not vote for Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nShe watched all the [GOP] debates, said the nurse, identified as Althea Thoone. She was very alert and kept up with all the news and current events, especially about the election. She said no true Republican would cast a vote for Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nShe was not happy at all because I dont believe she thought Donald Trump was a real Republican. She took a turn for the worse after the [11th] debate when he started talking about his private parts, and all that other nonsense about Mitt Romney getting down on his knees.\r\n\r\nDuring the debate held on March 4, Trump responded to Romneys public attack against him by saying, He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees. He would have dropped to his knees.\r\n\r\nTrump also alluded to the size of his penis during the debate, responding to a joke about the size of his hands told by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\r\n\r\nThe so-called 11th Commandment, Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican, once espoused by Ronald Reagan, now seems to be a relic from the past, when a kinder, gentler political sensibility existed in Washington, at least between members of the same party.\r\n\r\nHe broke that commandment, and a few others too, as far as Im concerned, said Thoone, who became somewhat of a confidant to Mrs. Reagan in her last years. She remembered that crack he made about her not being very beautiful too.\r\n\r\nI wouldnt say Donald Trump caused her to pass, because thats up to the Lord, but he certainly didnt help any. She couldnt believe what she was seeing and hearing up there. She would just look over to me and shake her head.\r\n\r\nThoone reports that Mrs. Reagan hoped to attend at least one of the GOP debates, but the strain of travel and her advanced age prevented such a trip. She was happy to see George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara at the Feb. 25 debate, says Thoone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reagans last public appearance was on July 6, 2015, at her 94th birthday celebration.",

    "text": "Before running against billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump for the presidency, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told an audience at a private, paid speech she wanted to see more successful businessmen and women run for office because they cant be bought.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made public by Wikileaks  which released an email from Hillary for America Research Director Tony Caark containing three attached speeches given at a private Goldman Sachs events  Clinton spoke and took audience questions at the Builders and Innovators Summit hosted by Goldman Sachs on October 29, 2013.\r\n\r\nAnswering a question about businessmen in politics, Clinton said that they are most often the people that look over the horizon, and therefore share a vision that many politicians of today lack. And thats a very good question and thank you for asking it. Yes, I would love to see more businessmen go into politics because I believe they would bring in an entirely different mindset and strategies than what were used to seeing traditionally, she opined.\r\n\r\nAnd then she just had to go on. In fact, when you say businessmen and women, I cant help but think of a particular one that I would just love to see running for the presidency at some point in the future, Clinton added. I dont know what it is exactly about him, I cant quite put my finger on it, but my instinct is almost never wrong. And its telling me that Donald Trump would be very successful if he were to venture into politics in the future.\r\n\r\nAsked to elaborate on her statement, the former Secretary of State argued that she thinks that businessmen cant be bought and that theyre very honest. And I think that goes especially for Donald Trump, whose successful projects and business ventures have made him synonymous with big business and, more importantly, creating thousands of jobs. I also think he understands the philanthropic and charitable side of things quite well, which is a crucial skill for any politician, she praised her current counter-candidate.\r\n\r\nI think he has a lot to offer to this country and its people, especially when were talking about the economy, she continued. Donald Trump has single-handedly helped stop the recession, more so than dozens of other so-called billionaires. And I dont know how the experts on the matter feel, but in my book thats hard evidence of the mans business prowess and integrity, as well. And I think everyone would agree those are commendable character traits for anyone looking to tackle the most difficult problems and challenges in the world, quite literally.\r\n\r\nSo, yes  Donald Trump is someone I could very easily see winning the support of the people. And I dont think he would do that with his flammable rhetoric and negotiation skills  which are both things hes known for  but with common sense and respect for his fellow countrymen. But, most of all  I think his relationship with the opposite sex would bring him the most political points. I think he respects women and treats them as equals and I also think that would bring him a significant lead over anyone unlucky enough to be running against him, she ominously concluded in her 2013 speech.",
